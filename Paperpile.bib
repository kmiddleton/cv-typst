              growth. The Craniofacial Growth Consortium Study (CGCS) combines
              craniofacial records from six of those growth studies (15,407
              lateral cephalograms from 1,913 individuals; 956 females, 957
              males, primarily European descent). Standard cephalometric points
              collected from the six studies in the CGCS allows direct
              comparison of craniofacial growth patterns across six North
              American locations. Three assessors collected all cephalometric
              points and the coordinates were averaged for each point. Twelve
              measures were calculated from the averaged coordinates. We
              implemented a multilevel double logistic equation to estimate
              growth trajectories fitting each trait separately by sex. Using
              Bayesian inference, we fit three models for each trait with
              different random effects structures to compare differences in
              growth patterns among studies. The models successfully identified
              important growth milestones (e.g., age at peak growth velocity,
              age at cessation of growth) for most traits. In a small number of
              cases, these milestones could not be determined due to truncated
              age ranges for some studies and slow, steady growth in some
              measurements. Results demonstrate great similarity among the six
              growth studies regarding craniofacial growth milestone estimates
              and the overall shape of the growth curve. These similarities
              suggest minor variation among studies resulting from differences
              in protocol, sample, or possible geographic variation. The
              analyses presented support combining the studies into the CGCS
              without substantial concerns of bias. The CGCS, therefore,

              biological growth. However, longitudinal samples are not
              typically possible, due to limits of time, prohibitive cost, or
              health concerns of repeat radiologic imaging. In contrast,
              cross-sectional samples have few such drawbacks, but it is not
              known how well estimates of growth milestones can be obtained
              from cross-sectional samples. The Craniofacial Growth Consortium
              Study (CGCS) contains longitudinal growth data for approximately
              2000 individuals. Single samples from the CGCS for individuals
              representing cross-sectional data were used to test the ability
              to predict growth parameters in linear trait measurements
              separately by sex. Testing across a range of cross-sectional
              sample sizes from 5 to the full sample, we found that means from
              repeated samples were able to approximate growth rates determined
              from the full longitudinal CGCS sample, with mean absolute
              differences below 1 mm at cross-sectional sample sizes greater
              than ~ 200 individuals. Our results show that growth parameters

              longitudinal data, underscoring the utility of such datasets in

                 for over 200 years, as one of the three known clades of
                 vertebrates to have evolved flapping flight. The smallest
                 pterosaurs were comparable in size to the smallest extant
                 birds and bats, but the largest pterosaurs were vastly larger
                 than any extant flier. This immense size range, coupled with
                 poor preservation and adaptations for flight unknown in extant
                 vertebrates, have made interpretations of pterosaur flight
                 problematic and often contentious. Here we review the
                 anatomical, evolutionary, and phylogenetic history of
                 pterosaurs, as well as the views, perspectives, and biases
                 regarding their interpretation. In recent years, three areas
                 of pterosaur biology have faced challenges and made advances:
                 structure of the wing membrane, function of the pteroid, body

  abstract    = "Unlike flapping birds and insects, bats possess membrane wings
                 that are more similar to many gliding mammals. The vast
                 majority of the wing is composed of a thin compliant skin
                 membrane stretched between the limbs, hand, and body. Membrane
                 wings are of particular interest because they may offer many
                 advantages to micro air vehicles. One critical feature of
                 membrane wings is that they camber passively in response to
                 aerodynamic load, potentially allowing for simplified wing
                 control. However, for maximum membrane wing performance,
                 tuning of the membrane structure to aerodynamic conditions is
                 necessary. Bats possess an array of muscles, the
                 plagiopatagiales proprii, embedded within the wing membrane
                 that could serve to tune membrane stiffness, or may have
                 alternative functions. We recorded the electromyogram from the
                 plagiopatagiales proprii muscles of Artibeus jamaicensis, the
                 Jamaican fruit bat, in flight at two different speeds and
                 found that these muscles were active during downstroke. For
                 both low- and high-speed flight, muscle activity increased
                 between late upstroke and early downstroke and decreased at
                 late downstroke. Thus, the array of plagiopatagiales may
                 provide a mechanism for bats to increase wing stiffness and
                 thereby reduce passive membrane deformation. These muscles
                 also activate in synchrony, presumably as a means to maximize
                 force generation, because each muscle is small and, by
                 estimation, weak. Small differences in activation timing were
                 observed when comparing low- and high-speed flight, which may
                 indicate that bats modulate membrane stiffness differently
                 depending on flight speed.",

               osteological correlates derived from extant sauropsids and infer
               trends in character transitions along the theropod and
               sauropodomorph lineagues. Femora and pelves of 107
               dinosauromorphs and outgroup taxa were digitized using 3D
               imaging techniques. Key transitions were estimated using maximum
               likelihood ancestral state reconstruction. The hips of
               dinosauromorphs possessed wide a disparity of soft tissue
               morphologies beyond the types and combinations exhibited by
               extant archosaurs. Early evolution of the dinosauriform hip
               joint was characterized by the retention of a prominent femoral
               hyaline cartilage cone in post-neonatal individuals, with the
               cartilage cone independently reduced within theropods and
               sauropodomorphs. The femur of Dinosauriformes possessed a
               fibrocartilage sleeve on the metaphysis, which surrounded a
               hyaline core. The acetabulum of Dinosauriformes possessed
               distinct labrum and antitrochanter structures. In
               sauropodomorphs, hip congruence was maintained by thick hyaline
               cartilage on the femoral head, whereas theropods relied on
               acetabular tissues such as ligaments and articular pads. In
               particular, the craniolaterally ossified hip capsule of
               non-Avetheropoda neotheropods permitted mostly parasagittal
               femoral movements. These data indicate that the dinosauromorph
               hip underwent mosaic evolution within the saurischian lineage

                 diversity",

  abstract    = "ABSTRACT The evolution of theropod flight has been
                 characterized as a shift from one to three locomotor modules.
                 Basal theropods, which were terrestrial bipeds, had a single
                 locomotor module composed of the hind limb and tail. In birds,
                 aerial locomotion was acquired with the origination of the
                 wing module and a decoupling of the hind limb and tail into
                 separate pelvic and caudal modules. This increase in
                 modularity is thought to have granted birds more locomotor
                 ?options? than non-avian theropods. More specifically, an
                 aerial locomotor system could have eased constraints on the
                 hind limb and allowed specialization for habitats and
                 lifestyles unavailable to non-birds. If so, bird hind limbs
                 should be more disparate than those of non-avian theropods. We
                 addressed this hypothesis by visualizing one aspect of limb
                 design, the proportions of the three main segments, using
                 ternary diagrams. Our results show that avian hind limb
                 proportions are much more disparate than those of non-avian
                 theropods. This broad range of limb design correlates with a
                 radiation in locomotor diversity founded on three locomotor
                 modules. We propose that birds have reached regions of
                 proportion morphospace that are off limits to bipeds with only
                 one locomotor module. In comparison, the limbs of non-avian
                 theropods are conservatively proportioned. Despite great
                 variation in body size, theropods other than birds do not
                 exhibit specializations for locomotion other than terrestrial

               the body, including the pectoral girdle, yet little is known
               about the architecture of the pectoral musculature. Muscle
               architecture is a critical variable in determining the
               biomechanical function of the vertebrate musculoskeletal system;
               however, accurate three-dimensional (3D) understanding of muscle
               architecture has been historically difficult to acquire. Here,
               we present a musculoskeletal model of a European starling
               (Sturnus vulgaris) pectoral girdle generated from iodine
               contrast-enhanced micro-computed-tomography (CT) data and 3D
               fiber tracking analysis. We used a template-based fiber-tracking
               algorithm to reconstruct muscle fibers in 3D based on grayscale
               differences in CT images, which allowed us to estimate fascicle
               lengths, pennation angles, muscle volumes, and physiological
               cross-sectional area. Our modeled muscles were qualitatively
               accurate; however, quantitative muscle architecture data
               differed between digital and traditional gross-dissection
               methods reflecting the complex organization of the tissue and
               differing natures of data collection. We found that model
               quality is affected by the resolution of CT image data and the
               fiber-tracking program's input parameters. Nonetheless, digital
               fiber tracking offers numerous advantages over gross-dissection
               methods, most importantly, the ability to visualize and quantify
               entire muscles in three-dimensions, yielding a much more
               accurate estimation of whole muscle architecture.",

  abstract = "Background: Estimates pertaining to the timing of the adolescent
              growth spurt (e.g. peak height velocity; PHV), including age at
              peak height velocity (aPHV), play a critical role in the
              diagnosis, treatment, and management of skeletal growth and/or
              developmental disorders. Yet, distinct statistical methodologies
              often result in large estimate discrepancies.Aim: The aim of the
              present study was to assess the advantages and disadvantages of
              three modelling methodologies for height as well as to determine
              how estimates derived from these methodologies may differ,
              particularly those that may be useful in paediatric clinical
              practice.Subjects and methods: Height data from 686 individuals
              of the Fels Longitudinal Study were modelled using 5th order
              polynomials, natural cubic splines, and SuperImposition by
              Translation and Rotation (SITAR) to determine aPHV and PHV for
              all individuals together (i.e. population average) by sex and
              separately for each individual. Estimates within and between
              methodologies were calculated and compared.Results: In general,
              mean aPHV was earlier, and PHV was greater for individuals when
              compared to estimates from population average models. Significant
              differences between mean aPHV and PHV for individuals were
              observed in all three methodologies, with SITAR exhibiting the
              latest aPHV and largest PHV estimates.Conclusion: Each
              statistical methodology has a number of advantages when used for
              specific purposes. For modelling growth in individuals, as one
              would in paediatric clinical practice, we recommend the use of
              the 5th order polynomial methodology due to its parameter
              flexibility.",

                 function across the 230-million-year history of theropod
                 evolution. Forelimb disparity was assessed by plotting the
                 relative contributions of the three main limb elements on a
                 ternary diagram. Theropods were divided into five functional
                 groups: predatory, reduced, flying, wing-propelled diving, and
                 flighdess. Forelimbs which maintained their primitive
                 function, predation, are similarly proportioned, but non-avian
                 theropods with highly reduced forelimbs have relatively longer
                 humeri. Despite the dramatically different forces imparted by
                 the evolution of flight, forelimb proportions of basal birds
                 are only slighdy different from those of their non-avian
                 relatives. An increase in disparity accompanied the subsequent
                 radiation of birds. Each transition to flightlessness has been
                 accompanied by an increase in relative humeral length, which
                 results from relatively short distal limb elements. We
                 introduce theoretical predictions based on five biomechanical
                 and developmental factors that may have influenced the
                 evolution of theropod limb proportions.",

  abstract = "Thermal tolerance is a fundamental physiological complex trait
              for survival in many species. For example, everyday tasks such as
              foraging, finding a mate, and avoiding predation, are highly
              dependent on how well an organism can tolerate extreme
              temperatures. Understanding the general architecture of the
              natural variants within the genes that control this trait is of
              high importance if we want to better comprehend thermal
              physiology. Here, we take a multipronged approach to further
              dissect the genetic architecture that controls thermal tolerance
              in natural populations using the Drosophila Synthetic Population
              Resource (DSPR) as a model system. First, we used quantitative
              genetics and Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) mapping to identify
              major effect regions within the genome that influences thermal
              tolerance, then integrated RNA-sequencing to identify differences
              in gene expression, and lastly, we used the RNAi system to 1)
              alter tissue-specific gene expression and 2) functionally
              validate our findings. This powerful integration of approaches
              not only allows for the identification of the genetic basis of
              thermal tolerance but also the physiology of thermal tolerance in
              a natural population, which ultimately elucidates thermal
              tolerance through a fitness-associated lens.",

  abstract = "The divergent specializations of living archosaurs, crocodilians
              and birds, represent two of the great transformations in
              vertebrate evolution. Despite hailing from common ancestor with a
              tall skull, braced palate and relatively unspecialized jaw
              muscles, these two living clades followed disparate paths in
              cranial biomechanics and feeding functional morphology during the
              Mesozoic era, resulting in the flat, rigid skulls in crocodylians
              and the bulbous and beaked, flexible skulls of birds. Here we use
              new approaches in imaging, 3D modeling, morphometrics, lever
              mechanics, finite element modeling and phylogenetic comparative
              methods of living and extinct reptiles to show how morphological
              and functional changes in the palate, cranial joints and jaw
              musculature occurred within the fossil record of these lineages
              that were key features in acquisition of the modern forms. We
              show how jaw muscles reoriented their resultants and moments
              about jaw joints during skull flattening, palatocranial suturing
              and feeding specializations in Jurassic crocodyliforms. These
              morphological changes resulted in a decrease in mechanical
              efficiency of the feeding apparatus that was compensated for by
              an increase in jaw muscle sizes and canalized muscle
              architecture. Meanwhile, along the line to living birds, the
              acquisition of enlarged brains in coelurosaur dinosaurs resulted
              in a shifting of temporal and palatal muscle positions, a
              canalization of vertically-oriented of muscle forces and
              consequently reorientation of their moments about palatocranial
              joints. These changes in loading environment, along with a
              concatenate increase in the propulsive and bending properties of
              the palate, facilitated cranial kinesis in neoavian birds.
              Together, these examples of evolutionary innovation in reptile
              cranial biomechanics reveal powerful new approaches to testing
              biomechanical and evolutionary hypotheses in any cranial or

  abstract = "Accurate and repeatable assessments of three-dimensional (3D)
              skeletal morphology are critical to interpretations of vertebrate
              functional anatomy. In skeletal specimens, these goals can be
              accomplished using in-silico models derived from 3D laser scan,
              photogrammetry, or computed tomography (CT) data. Assessments of
              skeletal morphology in living subjects, especially humans, are
              more challenging and are often either cost-prohibitive (e.g.,
              magnetic resonance) or expose subjects to high doses of ionizing
              radiation (e.g., CT). Here, we present a new, open-source method
              for assessing 3D skeletal morphology using ultra-low dose
              biplanar radiographs. Biplanar radiographs were obtained using an
              EOS Imaging System (EOS Imaging, Inc., Paris, France). A
              custom-built calibration frame with radiopaque markers was
              scanned using this system on multiple days in multiple positions
              inside the scanning space. We quantified the 3D coordinates of
              markers by placing landmarks at the center of each marker in both
              anterior-posterior and lateral radiographs. Landmark data for
              each scan were collected independently by two observers to
              determine inter-observer error. 3D coordinates of landmarks in
              each scan differed by <1 mm between observers, suggesting strong
              repeatability in assessing morphology of living subjects. To
              assess distortion in EOS images, we constructed a second
              calibration device, a flat plate with radiopaque markers at the
              corners of three squares with 10 cm, 20 cm, and 30 cm sides,
              respectively, surrounding an origin point. The calibration plate
              was scanned with the origin point at the center of the scan area
              and the sides of the squares parallel to the detectors. We
              identified distortion at the edges of EOS images which could
              significantly impact measurements on skeletal features near the
              margins of the scan area (i.e., hips, pelvis, lower limbs) and
              developed a method to mathematically correct for resulting
              distortion in landmark data. Finally, we demonstrate this method
              using measurements of iliac blade and spinous process orientation
              in a sample of living human participants. This method will be
              applicable to studies of multiple human cohorts, including
              symptomatic and asymptomatic groups, as well as to other biplanar
              radiograph platforms and study organisms.",

              of Homo sapiens and Pan troglodytes in 3D. Each specimen was
              fixed, stained with Lugol's iodine, and microCT scanned [<61 µm

              segmented using Avizo. Avizo Xfiber was used to visualize and
              quantify fascicle orientation within muscles, which permits
              quantification of both whole muscle and within muscle fascicle
              orientations. Fascicle length, pennation angles and muscle volume
              were used to calculate PCSA and estimate force output of each
              muscle. Together, these data are used to compare functional

              differences in force-generating capacity and force orientations

              found in the adductor pollicis and opponens pollicis, which are
              larger and more transversely oriented in humans than in
              chimpanzees. Data also reveal differences in other thenar and
              hypothenar muscles, affecting the capacity to effect different
              grips. Our approach and results highlight the importance of
              evaluating of the musculoskeletal system of the hand in 3D which
              can then be used to compare to bone form across hominoids.",

               musculature which powers the feeding apparatus. However we still
               know little about jaw muscle mechanics within lineages of
               reptiles or how this complicated musculoskeletal system has
               evolved to employ a variety of behaviors. New imaging and
               computational methods are now enabling an extraordinary view
               into the 3D anatomy and biomechanics of reptiles and other
               vertebrates. Here we illustrate several approaches to analyzing
               jaw muscle morphology and architecture using contrast imaging,
               3D fiber tracking, biomechanical analysis, and data
               visualization methods that offer enormous potential for
               exploring the anatomy, function and evolution of jaw muscles. We
               first illustrate basic workflow of 3D jaw muscle visualization,
               morphometrics and interpretation using crocodilian jaw muscle
               anatomy. Second, we show how homologous jaw muscle bellies
               evolve among lineages of different reptiles and birds to elicit
               different functional demands. Third, we show how the 3D
               architecture of hard-to-dissect, small, deep protractor muscles
               correlate with different types of cranial kinesis among a sample
               of lizards and birds. These new imaging and analytical
               approaches offer incredible potential for the quantification of
               soft tissue morphology like muscle architecture and their
               applications to comparative biomechanics, ecomorphology, and
               evolutionary biology should prove remarkable.",

              broad implications for researchers interested in intergroup

              cohesion. Using detailed records tracking the movements and life
              histories of Finnish evacuees during World War II, we find that
              evacuees who intermarry are more likely to be educated, work in
              professional occupations, marry someone higher in social status
              and remain in the host community. Evacuees who intermarry before
              the war have fewer children, whereas those who marry into their
              host community after the war have more children. These results
              indicate that life-history and assimilation outcomes depend on
              key differences between pre-war environments-when migrants are
              living in their own communities-and post-war environments-when
              migrants are living in the host community. Overall, this suggests
              that integration involves a trade-off between reproduction and

              whereas those who maintain stronger bonds with their natal
              communities have higher fertility. We discuss these results

                 activity and fixed for a Mendelian recessive allele that
                 reduces hind-limb muscle mass by 50\% (Line 3), non-selected

                 revolutions/day among weeks (P = 0.003), but the effect size
                 was small (10\%). Significant main effects for wheel running
                 were also revealed for sex and line (P < 0.001). The grand
                 mean +/- SD for the coefficient of variation (CV) of
                 intra-individual wheel running was 23.0 +/- 10.8\%. Although a
                 significant main effect for the CV was found for week, the
                 effect size was low (7\%) (age 6 weeks, 23.4 +/- 10.9\%; age 7
                 weeks, 25.1 +/- 13.2\%; age 8 weeks, 20.1 +/- 7.8\%). The

                 ternary diagram. Theropods were divided into five functional
                 groups: predatory, reduced, flying, wing-propelled diving, and
                 flighdess. Forelimbs which maintained their primitive
                 function, predation, are similarly proportioned, but non-avian
                 theropods with highly reduced forelimbs have relatively longer

                 measurements of the wake velocity field behind the bat. The

                 a reversed or opposable digit I (hallux). Primitively, the
                 hallux of nonavian theropod dinosaurs was unreversed and lay
                 parallel to digits II-IV. Among basal birds, a unique digital
                 innovation evolved in which the hallux opposes digits II-IV.
                 This digital configuration is critical for grasping and
                 perching. I studied skeletons of modern birds with a range of
                 hallucal designs, from unreversed (anteromedially directed) to
                 fully reversed (posteriorly directed). Two primary correlates
                 of hallucal orientation were revealed. First, the fossa into
                 which metatarsal I articulates is oriented slightly more
                 posteriorly on the tarsometatarsus, rotating the digit as a
                 unit. Second, metatarsal I exhibits a distinctive torsion of
                 its distal shaft relative to its proximal articulation with
                 the tarsometatarsus, reorienting the distal condyles and
                 phalanges of digit I. Herein, I present a method that
                 facilitates the re-evaluation of hallucal orientation in
                 fossil avians based on morphology alone. This method also
                 avoids potential misinterpretations of hallucal orientation in

  abstract    = "Turning in flight requires reorientation of force, which
                 birds, bats and insects accomplish either by shifting body
                 position and total force in concert or by using left-right
                 asymmetries in wingbeat kinematics. Although both mechanisms
                 have been observed in multiple species, it is currently
                 unknown how each is used to control changes in trajectory. We
                 addressed this problem by measuring body and wingbeat
                 kinematics as hummingbirds tracked a revolving feeder, and
                 estimating aerodynamic forces using a quasi-steady model.
                 During arcing turns, hummingbirds symmetrically banked the
                 stroke plane of both wings, and the body, into turns,
                 supporting a body-dependent mechanism. However, several
                 wingbeat asymmetries were present during turning, including a
                 higher and flatter outer wingtip path and a lower more
                 deviated inner wingtip path. A quasi-steady analysis of arcing
                 turns performed with different trajectories revealed that
                 changes in radius were associated with asymmetrical kinematics
                 and forces, and changes in velocity were associated with
                 symmetrical kinematics and forces. Collectively, our results
                 indicate that both body-dependent and -independent force
                 orientation mechanisms are available to hummingbirds, and that
                 these kinematic strategies are used to meet the separate
                 aerodynamic challenges posed by changes in velocity and
                 turning radius.",

                 mineralization or architecture. Here, we used nanoindentation
                 to precisely measure compressive stiffness in the femoral
                 mid-diaphysis of mice that had experienced 37 generations of
                 selective breeding for high levels of voluntary wheel running
                 (HR). Mice (n = 48 total), half from HR lines and half from
                 non-selected control (C) lines, were divided into two
                 experimental groups, one with 13-14 weeks of access to a
                 running wheel and one housed without wheels (n = 12 in each
                 group). At the end of the experiment, gross and micro-computed
                 tomography (microCT)-based morphometric traits were measured,
                 and reduced elastic modulus (E(r)) was estimated separately
                 for four anatomical quadrants of the femoral cortex: anterior,
                 posterior, lateral, and medial. Two-way, mixed-model analysis
                 of covariance (ancova) showed that body mass was a highly
                 significant predictor of all morphometric traits and that
                 structural change is more apparent at the microCT level than
                 in conventional morphometrics of whole bones. Both line type
                 (HR vs. C) and presence of the mini-muscle phenotype (caused
                 by a Mendelian recessive allele and characterized by a
                 approximately 50\% reduction in mass of the gastrocnemius
                 muscle complex) were significant predictors of femoral
                 cortical cross-sectional anatomy. Measurement of reduced
                 modulus obtained by nanoindentation was repeatable within a
                 single quadrant and sensitive enough to detect
                 inter-individual differences. Although we found no significant
                 effects of line type (HR vs. C) or physical activity (wheel
                 vs. no wheel) on mean stiffness, anterior and posterior
                 quadrants were significantly stiffer (P < 0.0001) than medial
                 and lateral quadrants (32.67 and 33.09 GPa vs. 29.78 and 30.46
                 GPa, respectively). Our findings of no significant difference
                 in compressive stiffness in the anterior and posterior
                 quadrants agree with previous results for mice, but differ
                 from those for large mammals. Integrating these results with
                 others from ongoing research on these mice, we hypothesize

                 (originally inbred strains, more recently knockouts and
                 transgenics) rely on the study of mutant or
                 laboratory-manipulated phenotypes, we have studied changes in
                 skeletal morphometrics resulting from many generations of
                 artificial selection for high activity in the form of wheel
                 running, in which mice engage voluntarily. Mice from the four
                 replicate High Runner (HR) lines run nearly three times as
                 many revolutions during days 5 and 6 of a 6-day exposure to
                 wheels (1.12 m circumference). We have found significant
                 changes in skeletal dimensions of the hind limbs, including
                 decreased directional asymmetry, larger femoral heads, and
                 wider distal femora. The latter two have been hypothesized as
                 evolutionary adaptations for long-distance locomotion in
                 hominids. Exercise-training studies involving experimental
                 groups with and without access to wheels have shown increased
                 diameters of both femora and tibiafibulae, and suggest genetic
                 effects on trainability (genotype-by-environment
                 interactions). Reanalysis of previously published data on bone
                 masses of hind limbs revealed novel patterns of change in bone
                 mass associated with access to wheels for 2 months. Without
                 access to wheels, HR mice have significantly heavier
                 tibiafibulae and foot bones, whereas with chronic access to
                 wheels, a significant increase in foot bone mass that was
                 linearly related to increases in daily wheel running was
                 observed. Mice exhibiting a recently discovered small-muscle
                 phenotype (``mini-muscle,'' [MM] caused by a Mendelian
                 recessive gene), in which the mass of the triceps surae muscle
                 complex is ∼50\% lower than in normal individuals, have
                 significantly longer and thinner bones in the hind limb. We

                 mass in Control, HR, and MM phenotypes in mice of 1-7 weeks
                 postnatal age. Statistical comparisons reveal highly
                 significant differences both in triceps surae mass and
                 mass-corrected triceps surae mass between normal and MM mice
                 at all but the postnatal age of 1 week. Based on previously
                 observed differences in distributions of myosin isoforms in
                 adult MM mice, we hypothesize that a reduction of myosin

                 hominin activity levels from skeletal remains, an approach
                 based on the well-documented ability of bone to adjust to its
                 loading environment during life. However, diaphyseal structure
                 is also determined in part by genetic factors. This study
                 investigates the possibility that genetic variation underlying
                 diaphyseal structure is influenced by the activity levels of
                 ancestral populations and might also have functional
                 significance in an evolutionary context. We adopted an
                 experimental evolution approach and tested for differences in
                 femoral diaphyseal structure in 1-week-old mice from a line
                 that had been artificially selected (45 generations) for high
                 voluntary wheel running and non-selected controls. As adults,
                 selected mice are significantly more active on wheels and in
                 home cages, and have thicker diaphyses. Structural differences
                 at 1 week can be assumed to primarily reflect the effects of
                 selective breeding rather than direct mechanical stimuli,
                 given that the onset of locomotion in mice is shortly after
                 Day 7. We hypothesized that if genetically determined
                 diaphyseal structure reflects the activity patterns of members
                 of a lineage, then selected animals will have relatively
                 larger diaphyseal dimensions at 1 week compared to controls.
                 The results provide strong support for this hypothesis and
                 suggest that limb bone cross sections may not always only
                 reflect the activity levels of particular fossil individuals,
                 but also convey an evolutionary signal providing information

                 specialized for flight, reflecting both evolutionary history
                 and the need to maintain structural integrity while generating
                 aerodynamic forces. METHODS: We analyzed the anatomical
                 structure of bat wing skeletons in the context of scaling
                 patterns relative to other mammals, material properties and
                 the mechanical function of the wing bones during flight.
                 RESULTS: Compared with nonvolant mammals, the bones of the bat
                 forelimb are elongated, even after correcting for shared
                 phylogenetic history. Bats have consistently larger-diameter
                 bones in the forelimb than do nonvolant mammals but
                 significantly narrower hindlimb bones. Mineralization in the
                 cortical bone of wings is lower than in the long bones of
                 other adult mammals, with a proximodistal gradient of
                 decreasing mineralization. The distal phalanges have only a
                 small amount of mineralized tissue underlying the articular

  abstract    = "In this study we compared the wing kinematics of 27 bats
                 representing six pteropodid species ranging more than 40 times
                 in body mass (M(b)=0.0278-1.152 kg), to determine whether wing
                 posture and overall wing kinematics scaled as predicted
                 according to theory. The smallest species flew in a wind
                 tunnel and the other five species in a flight corridor.
                 Seventeen kinematic markers on the midline and left side of
                 the body were tracked in three dimensions. We used
                 phylogenetically informed reduced major axis regression to
                 test for allometry. We found that maximum wingspan (b(max))
                 and maximum wing area (S(max)) scaled with more positive
                 allometry, and wing loading (Q(s)) with more negative
                 allometry (b(max)∝M(b)(0.423); S(max)∝M(b)(0.768);
                 Q(s)∝M(b)(0.233)) than has been reported in previous studies
                 that were based on measurements from specimens stretched out
                 flat on a horizontal surface. Our results suggest that larger
                 bats open their wings more fully than small bats do in flight,
                 and that for bats, body measurements alone cannot be used to
                 predict the conformation of the wings in flight. Several
                 kinematic variables, including downstroke ratio, wing stroke
                 amplitude, stroke plane angle, wing camber and Strouhal
                 number, did not change significantly with body size,
                 demonstrating that many aspects of wing kinematics are similar
                 across this range of body sizes. Whereas aerodynamic theory
                 suggests that preferred flight speed should increase with
                 mass, we did not observe an increase in preferred flight speed
                 with mass. Instead, larger bats had higher lift coefficients
                 (C(L)) than did small bats (C(L)∝M(b)(0.170)). Also, the slope
                 of the wingbeat period (T) to body mass regression was
                 significantly more shallow than expected under isometry
                 (T∝M(b)(0.180)), and angle of attack (α) increased
                 significantly with body mass [α∝log(M(b))7.738]. None of the
                 bats in our study flew at constant speed, so we used multiple
                 regression to isolate the changes in wing kinematics that
                 correlated with changes in flight speed, horizontal
                 acceleration and vertical acceleration. We uncovered several
                 significant trends that were consistent among species. Our
                 results demonstrate that for medium- to large-sized bats, the
                 ways that bats modulate their wing kinematics to produce
                 thrust and lift over the course of a wingbeat cycle are
                 independent of body size.",

  abstract    = "Three-dimensional computational modeling offers tools with
                 which to investigate forces experienced by the skull during
                 feeding and other behaviors. American alligators (Alligator
                 mississippiensis) generate some of the highest measured bite
                 forces among extant tetrapods. A concomitant increase in bite
                 force accompanies ontogenetic increases in body mass, which
                 has been linked with dietary changes as animals increase in
                 size. Because the flattened skull of crocodylians has
                 substantial mediolaterally oriented muscles, crocodylians are
                 an excellent model taxon in which to explore the role of
                 mediolateral force components experienced by the feeding
                 apparatus. Many previous modeling studies of archosaur cranial
                 function focused on planar analysis, ignoring the mediolateral
                 aspects of cranial forces. Here, we used three-dimensionally
                 accurate anatomical data to resolve 3D muscle forces. Using
                 dissection, imaging and computational techniques, we developed
                 lever and finite element models of an ontogenetic series of
                 alligators to test the effects of size and shape on cranial
                 loading and compared estimated bite forces with those
                 previously measured in vivo in A. mississippiensis We found
                 that modeled forces matched in vivo data well for
                 intermediately sized individuals, and somewhat overestimated
                 force in smaller specimens and underestimated force in larger
                 specimens, suggesting that ontogenetically static muscular
                 parameters and bony attachment sites alone cannot account for
                 all the variation in bite force. Adding aponeurotic muscle
                 attachments would likely improve force predictions, but such
                 data are challenging to model and integrate into analyses of
                 extant taxa and are generally unpreserved in fossils. We
                 conclude that anatomically accurate modeling of muscles can be
                 coupled with finite element and lever analyses to produce
                 reliable, reasonably accurate estimate bite forces and thus
                 both skeletal and joint loading, with known sources of error,
                 which can be applied to extinct taxa.",

  abstract    = "The study of morphological evolution after the inferred origin
                 of active flight homologous with that in Aves has historically
                 been characterized by an emphasis on anatomically disjunct,
                 mosaic patterns of change. Relatively few prior studies have
                 used discrete morphological character data in a phylogenetic
                 context to quantitatively investigate morphological evolution
                 or mosaic evolution in particular. One such previously
                 employed method, which used summed unambiguously optimized
                 synapomorphies, has been the basis for proposing disassociated
                 and sequential ``modernizing'' or ``fine-tuning'' of pectoral
                 and then pelvic locomotor systems after the origin of flight
                 (``pectoral early-pelvic late'' hypothesis). We use one of the
                 most inclusive phylogenetic data sets of basal birds to
                 investigate properties of this method and to consider the
                 application of a Bayesian phylogenetic approach. Bayes factor
                 and statistical comparisons of branch length estimates were
                 used to evaluate support for a mosaic pattern of character
                 change and the specific pectoral early-pelvic late hypothesis.
                 Partitions were defined a priori based on anatomical subregion
                 (e.g., pelvic, pectoral) and were based on those hypothesized
                 using the summed synapomorphy approach. We compare 80 models
                 all implementing the M(k) model for morphological data but
                 varying in the number of anatomical subregion partitions, the
                 models for among-partition rate variation and among-character
                 rate variation, as well as the branch length prior.
                 Statistical analysis reveals that partitioning data by
                 anatomical subregion, independently estimating branch lengths
                 for partitioned data, and use of shared or per partition
                 gamma-shaped among-character rate distribution significantly
                 increases estimated model likelihoods. Simulation studies
                 reveal that partitioned models where characters are randomly
                 assigned perform significantly worse than both the observed
                 model and the single-partition equal-rate model, suggesting
                 that only partitioning by anatomical subregion increases model
                 performance. The preference for models with partitions defined
                 a priori by anatomical subregion is consistent with a
                 disjunctive pattern of character change for the data set
                 investigated and may have implications for parameterization of
                 Bayesian analyses of morphological data more generally.
                 Statistical tests of differences in estimated branch lengths
                 from the pectoral and pelvic partitions do not support the
                 specific pectoral early-pelvic late hypothesis proposed from
                 the summed synapomorphy approach; however, results suggest
                 limited support for some pectoral branch lengths being

                 the four replicate high runner (HR) lines averaged 2.85-fold
                 more revolutions per day as compared with four non-selected
                 control (C) lines, and females ran 1.11-fold more than males,
                 with no sex-by-linetype interaction. Analysis of variance
                 indicated significant differences among C lines but not among
                 HR for revolutions per day. By contrast, average speed varied
                 significantly among HR lines, but not among C, and showed a
                 sex-by-linetype interaction, with the HR/C ratio being 2.02

                 various physiological functions, including locomotion,
                 antinociception, emotional states, and motivated behaviors.
                 The ECS has been implicated in regulation of voluntary wheel
                 running in mice via actions at the cannabinoid receptor-1
                 (CB1). Previously, we showed that four replicate lines of mice
                 bred for high levels of voluntary wheel running (high-runner
                 or HR lines) sex-specifically (females only) decreased running
                 in response to antagonism of the CB1 receptor, as compared
                 with four unselected Control lines. Here, we administered a
                 CB1 receptor agonist, WIN 55,212-2 (WIN). We predicted that if
                 CB1 activation is involved in the regulation of voluntary
                 wheel running, then HR mice would show a greater response to
                 CB1 agonism. Following our previous protocols, mice from
                 generation 53 were acclimated to running wheels for 24 days,
                 then received, in random order, either an intra-peritoneal
                 injection of vehicle or a low (0.5 mg/kg), medium (1 mg/kg) or
                 high dosage (3 mg/kg) of WIN. Each mouse received an injection
                 and then experienced two nights without injections, for a
                 total period of 12 days. Response to WIN was quantified as
                 wheel revolutions, time spent running, and average running
                 speed in the 10-120 min immediately following injection.
                 Injection decreased wheel revolutions in all mice, but male HR
                 mice decreased their running to a greater degree relative to
                 Controls in response to the high dose of WIN over the entire
                 period analyzed, whereas HR females showed a differential
                 response relative to Controls only in the latter 70-120 min
                 post-injection. These results, in conjunction with our
                 previous study, show that (a) aspects of endocannabinoid
                 signaling have diverged in four lines of mice bred for high

  abstract    = "The biomechanical and neuromuscular mechanisms used by
                 different animals to generate turns in flight are highly
                 variable. Body size and body plan exert some influence, e.g.
                 birds typically roll their body to orient forces generated by
                 the wings whereas insects are capable of turning via
                 left-right wingbeat asymmetries. Turns are also relatively
                 brief and have low repeatability, with almost every wingbeat
                 serving a different function throughout the change in heading.
                 Here we present an analysis of Anna's hummingbirds (Calypte
                 anna) as they fed continuously from an artificial feeder
                 revolving around the outside of the animal. This setup allowed
                 for examination of sustained changes in yaw without requiring
                 any corresponding changes in pitch, roll or body position.
                 Hummingbirds sustained yaw turns by expanding the wing stroke
                 amplitude of the outer wing during the downstroke and by
                 altering the deviation of the wingtip path during both
                 downstroke and upstroke. The latter led to a shift in the
                 inner-outer stroke plane angle during the upstroke and shifts
                 in the elevation of the stroke plane and in the deviation of
                 the wingtip path during both strokes. These features are
                 generally more similar to how insects, as opposed to birds,
                 turn. However, time series analysis also revealed considerable
                 stroke-to-stroke variation. Changes in the stroke amplitude
                 and the wingtip velocity were highly cross-correlated, as were
                 changes in the stroke deviation and the elevation of the
                 stroke plane. As was the case for wingbeat kinematics,
                 electromyogram recordings from pectoral and wing muscles were
                 highly variable, but no correlations were found between these
                 two features of motor control. The high variability of both
                 kinematic and muscle activation features indicates a high
                 level of wingbeat-to-wingbeat adjustments during sustained
                 yaw. The activation timing of the muscles was more repeatable
                 than the activation intensity, which suggests that the former
                 may be constrained by harmonic motion and that the latter may
                 play a large role in kinematic adjustments. Comparing the
                 revolution frequency of the feeder with measurements of free
                 flight yaws reveals that feeder tracking, even at one
                 revolution every 2 s, is well below the maximum yaw capacity
                 of the hummingbirds.",

                 which might have important ramifications under natural
                 conditions. In laboratory rats, for example, acute stress has
                 been shown to increase anxiogenic behaviors for days after a
                 stressor. In this study, we quantified voluntary wheel-running
                 behavior for 22 h following a restraint stress and
                 glucocorticoid levels 24 h postrestraint. We utilized mice
                 from four replicate lines that have been selectively bred for
                 high voluntary wheel-running activity (HR mice) for 60
                 generations and their nonselected control (C) lines to examine
                 potential interactions between exercise propensity and
                 sensitivity to stress. Following 6 d of wheel access on a
                 12L∶12D photo cycle (0700-1900 hours, as during the routine
                 selective breeding protocol), 80 mice were physically
                 restrained for 40 min, beginning at 1400 hours, while another
                 80 were left undisturbed. Relative to unrestrained mice, wheel
                 running increased for both HR and C mice during the first hour
                 postrestraint (P < 0.0001) but did not differ 2 or 3 h
                 postrestraint. Wheel running was also examined at four
                 distinct phases of the photoperiod. Running in the period of
                 1600-1840 hours was unaffected by restraint stress and did not
                 differ statistically between HR and C mice. During the period
                 of peak wheel running (1920-0140 hours), restrained mice
                 tended to run fewer revolutions (-11\%; two-tailed P =
                 0.0733), while HR mice ran 473\% more than C (P = 0.0008),
                 with no restraint × line type interaction. Wheel running
                 declined for all mice in the latter part of the scotophase
                 (0140-0600 hours), restraint had no statistical effect on
                 wheel running, but HR again ran more than C (+467\%; P =
                 0.0122). Finally, during the start of the photophase
                 (0720-1200 hours), restraint increased running by an average
                 of 53\% (P = 0.0443) in both line types, but HR and C mice did
                 not differ statistically. Mice from HR lines had statistically
                 higher plasma corticosterone concentrations than C mice, with
                 no statistical effect of restraint and no interaction between
                 line type and restraint. Overall, these results indicate that

                 an increase in activity during a period of typical inactivity

                 response to their dynamic environment but also creates the
                 challenge of integrating different, and potentially
                 contradictory, sources of information for behavior control.
                 Understanding how multiple information streams are integrated
                 to produce flexible and reliable behavior is key to
                 understanding how behavior is controlled in natural settings.
                 Natural settings are rarely still, which challenges animals
                 that require precise body position control, like hummingbirds,
                 which hover while feeding from flowers. Tactile feedback,
                 available only once the hummingbird is docked at the flower,
                 could provide additional information to help maintain its
                 position at the flower. To investigate the role of tactile
                 information for hovering control during feeding, we first
                 asked whether hummingbirds physically interact with a feeder
                 once docked. We quantified physical interactions between
                 docked hummingbirds and a feeder placed in front of a
                 stationary background pattern. Force sensors on the feeder
                 measured a complex time course of loading that reflects the
                 wingbeat frequency and bill movement of feeding hummingbirds,
                 and suggests that they sometimes push against the feeder with
                 their bill. Next, we asked whether the measured tactile
                 interactions were used by feeding hummingbirds to maintain
                 position relative to the feeder. We created two experimental
                 scenarios-one in which the feeder was stationary and the
                 visual background moved and the other where the feeder moved
                 laterally in front of a white background. When the visual
                 background pattern moved, docked hummingbirds pushed
                 significantly harder in the direction of horizontal visual
                 motion. When the feeder moved, and the background was
                 stationary, hummingbirds generated aerodynamic force in the
                 opposite direction of the feeder motion. These results suggest
                 that docked hummingbirds are using visual information about
                 the environment to maintain body position and orientation, and
                 not actively tracking the motion of the feeder. The absence of
                 flower tracking behavior in hummingbirds contrasts with the
                 behavior of hawkmoths, and provides evidence that they rely
                 primarily on the visual background rather than flower-based
                 cues while feeding.",

                 frequently used by anthropologists and paleontologists to
                 infer the loading histories of past populations. To address
                 some underlying assumptions, we investigated the relative
                 roles of genetics and exercise on bone cross-sectional
                 geometry and bending mechanics in three mouse strains: high
                 bone density (C3H/He), low bone density (C57BL/6), and a
                 high-runner strain homozygous for the Myh4Minimscallele (MM).
                 METHODS AND MATERIALS: Weanlings of each strain were divided
                 into exercise (wheel) or control (sedentary) treatment groups
                 for a 7-week experimental period. Morphometrics of the femoral
                 mid-diaphysis and mechanical testing were used to assess both
                 theoretical and ex vivo bending mechanics. RESULTS: Across all
                 measured morphological and bending traits, we found relatively
                 small effects of exercise treatment compared to larger and
                 more frequent interstrain differences. In the exercised group,
                 total distance run over the experimental period was not a
                 predictor of any morphological or bending traits.
                 Cross-sectional geometry did not accurately predict bone
                 response to loading. DISCUSSION: Results from this
                 experimental model do not support hypothesized associations
                 among extreme exercise, cross-sectional geometry, and bending
                 mechanics. Our results suggest that analysis of
                 cross-sectional geometry alone is insufficient to predict
                 loading response, and questions the common assumption that
                 cross-sectional geometry differences are indicative of
                 differential loading history.",

                 running by four replicate lines of mice that have been
                 selectively bred for high voluntary wheel running and have
                 reached an apparent selection limit. To increase oxygen
                 transport capacity, erythrocyte density was elevated by the
                 administration of an erythropoietin (EPO) analogue. Mice were
                 given two EPO injections, two days apart, at one of two dose
                 levels (100 or 300 microg kg(-1)). Hemoglobin concentration
                 ([Hb]), maximal aerobic capacity during forced treadmill
                 exercise (VO2,max) and voluntary wheel running were measured.
                 [Hb] did not differ between high runner (HR) and non-selected
                 control (C) lines without EPO treatment. Both doses of EPO
                 significantly (P<0.0001) increased [Hb] as compared with
                 sham-injected animals, with no difference in [Hb] between the
                 100 microg kg(-1) and 300 microg kg(-1) dose levels (overall
                 mean of 4.5 g dl(-1) increase). EPO treatment significantly
                 increased VO2,max by approximately 5\% in both the HR and C
                 lines, with no dose x line type interaction. However, wheel
                 running (revolutions per day) did not increase with EPO
                 treatment in either the HR or C lines, and in fact

                 These results suggest that neither [Hb] per se nor VO2,max is
                 limiting voluntary wheel running in the HR lines. Moreover, we
                 hypothesize that the decrease in wheel running at the higher
                 dose of EPO may reflect direct action on the reward pathway of

  abstract = "The extinct nonavian dinosaur Tyrannosaurus rex, considered one
              of the hardest biting animals ever, is often hypothesized to have
              exhibited cranial kinesis, or, mobility of cranial joints
              relative to the braincase. Cranial kinesis in T. rex is a
              biomechanical paradox in that forcefully biting tetrapods usually
              possess rigid skulls instead of skulls with movable joints. We
              tested the biomechanical performance of a tyrannosaur skull using
              a series of static positions mimicking possible excursions of the
              palate to evaluate Postural Kinetic Competency in Tyrannosaurus.
              A functional extant phylogenetic bracket was employed using taxa,
              which exhibit measurable palatal excursions: Psittacus erithacus
              (fore-aft movement) and Gekko gecko (mediolateral movement).
              Static finite element models of Psittacus, Gekko, and
              Tyrannosaurus were constructed and tested with different palatal
              postures using anatomically informed material properties, loaded
              with muscle forces derived from dissection, phylogenetic
              bracketing, and a sensitivity analysis of muscle architecture and
              tested in orthal biting simulations using element strain as a
              proxy for model performance. Extant species models showed lower
              strains in naturally occurring postures compared to alternatives.
              We found that fore-aft and neutral models of Tyrannosaurus
              experienced lower overall strains than mediolaterally shifted
              models. Protractor muscles dampened palatal strains, while
              occipital constraints increased strains about palatocranial
              joints compared to jaw joint constraints. These loading behaviors
              suggest that even small excursions can strain elements beyond
              structural failure. Thus, these postural tests of kinesis, along
              with the robusticity of other cranial features, suggest that the
              skull of Tyrannosaurus was functionally akinetic. Anat Rec,

              kinetic species possess a particular suite of features to
              accomplish this movement, including flexible cranial joints and
              protractor musculature. Whereas the musculoskeletal anatomy of
              these kinetic systems is well understood, how these joints are
              biomechanically loaded, how different soft tissues affect joint
              loading and kinetic capacity, and how the protractor musculature
              loads the skull remain poorly understood. Here, we present a
              finite element model of the savannah monitor, Varanus
              exanthematicus, a modestly kinetic lizard, to better elucidate
              the roles of soft tissue in mobile joints and protractor
              musculature in cranial loading. We describe the 3D resultants of
              jaw muscles and the histology of palatobasal, otic and jaw
              joints. We tested the effects of joint tissue type, bite point
              and muscle load to evaluate the biomechanical role of muscles on
              the palate and braincase. We found that the jaw muscles have
              significant mediolateral components that can impart stability
              across palatocranial joints. Articular tissues affect the
              magnitude of strains experienced around the palatobasal and otic
              joints. Without protractor muscle loading, the palate, quadrate
              and braincase experience higher strains, suggesting this muscle
              helps insulate the braincase and palatoquadrate from high loads.
              We found that the cross-sectional properties of the bones of V.
              exanthematicus are well suited for performing under torsional
              loads. These findings suggest that torsional loading regimes may

              incongruent bony hip joints, suggesting that large volumes of
              soft tissues mediated hip articulation. To understand the
              evolutionary trends and functional relationships between body
              size and hip anatomy of saurischians, we tested the relationships
              among discrete and continuous morphological characters using
              phylogenetically corrected regression. Giant theropods and
              sauropods convergently evolved highly cartilaginous hip joints by
              reducing supraacetabular ossifications, a condition unlike that
              in early dinosauromorphs. However, transitions in femoral and
              acetabular soft tissues indicate that large sauropods and
              theropods built their hip joints in fundamentally different ways.
              In sauropods, the femoral head possesses irregularly rugose
              subchondral surfaces for thick hyaline cartilage. Hip
              articulation was achieved primarily using the highly
              cartilaginous femoral head and the supraacetabular labrum on the
              acetabular ceiling. In contrast, theropods covered their femoral
              head and neck with thinner hyaline cartilage and maintained
              extensive articulation between the fibrocartilaginous femoral
              neck and the antitrochanter. These findings suggest that the hip
              joints of giant sauropods were built to sustain large compressive

              retrospective, longitudinal study. Five linear measurements were
              collected from lateral cephalograms as part of the Craniofacial
              Growth Consortium Study (CGCS). Four estimates of growth
              cessation, including 2 asymptote- (GCasym, GCerr) and 2
              rate-based (GCabs, GC10\%) methods, from double logistic models
              of craniofacial growth were compared. PARTICIPANTS: Cephalometric
              data from participants in 6 historic longitudinal growth studies
              were included in the CGCS. At least 1749 individuals (870
              females, 879 males), unaffected by craniofacial anomalies, were
              included in all analyses. Individuals were represented by a
              median of 11 images between 2.5 and 31.3 years of age. RESULTS:
              GCasym consistently occurred before GCerr and GCabs consistently
              occurred before GC10\% within the rate-based approaches. The
              ordering of the asymptote-based methods compared to the
              rate-based methods was not consistent across measurements or
              between males and females. Across the 5 measurements, age at
              growth cessation ranged from 13.56 (females, nasion-basion,
              GCasym) to 24.39 (males, sella-gonion, GCerr). CONCLUSIONS:
              Adolescent growth cessation is an important milestone for
              treatment planning. Based on our findings, we recommend careful
              consideration of specific definitions of growth cessation in both
              clinical and research settings since the most appropriate
              estimation method may differ according to patients' needs. The
              different methods presented here provide useful estimates of

  abstract  = "Jaw muscles are key features of the vertebrate feeding
               apparatus. The jaw musculature is housed in the skull whose
               morphology reflects a compromise between multiple functions,
               including feeding, housing sensory structures, and defense, and
               the skull constrains jaw muscle geometry. Thus, jaw muscle
               anatomy may be suboptimally oriented for the production of bite
               force. Crocodylians are a group of vertebrates that generate the
               highest bite forces ever measured with a flat skull suited to
               their aquatic ambush predatory style. However, basal members of
               the crocodylian line (e.g., Prestosuchus) were terrestrial
               predators with plesiomorphically tall skulls, and thus the
               origin of modern crocodylians involved a substantial
               reorganization of the feeding apparatus and its jaw muscles.
               Here, we reconstruct jaw muscles across a phylogenetic range of
               crocodylians and fossil suchians to investigate the impact of
               skull flattening on muscle anatomy. We used imaging data to
               create 3D models of extant and fossil suchians that demonstrate
               the evolution of the crocodylian skull, using osteological
               correlates to reconstruct muscle attachment sites. We found that
               jaw muscle anatomy in early fossil suchians reflected the
               ancestral archosaur condition but experienced progressive shifts
               in the lineage leading to Metasuchia. In early fossil suchians,
               musculus adductor mandibulae posterior and musculus pterygoideus
               (mPT) were of comparable size, but by Metasuchia, the jaw
               musculature is dominated by mPT. As predicted, we found that
               taxa with flatter skulls have less efficient muscle orientations
               for the production of high bite force. This study highlights the
               diversity and evolution of jaw muscles in one of the great
               transformations in vertebrate evolution.",

               Iodine-contrast microCT approaches are enabling new insights
               into the anatomy of muscles, nerves, and other soft tissues of
               embryonic as well as adult specimens of alligators. These
               imaging data and other muscle modeling methods offer increased
               accuracy of muscle sizes and attachments without destructive
               methods like dissection. 3D modeling approaches and imaging data
               together now enable us to see and reconstruct 3D muscle
               architecture which then allows us to estimate 3D muscle
               resultants, but also measurements of pennation in ways not seen
               before. These methods have already revealed new information on
               the ontogeny, diversity, and function of jaw muscles and the
               heads of alligators and other crocodylians. Such approaches will
               lead to enhanced and accurate analyses of form, function, and

              proportions is more complex than previously thought as some
              traits formerly associated with climate adaptation are better
              explained by geographic proximity and neutral evolutionary
              forces. While the recent incorporation of quantitative genetic
              methodologies has improved understanding of patterns related to
              climate in Africa, Europe, and the Americas, Asia remains
              underrepresented in recent and historic studies of body form. As
              ecogeographic studies tend to focus on male morphology, potential
              sex differences in features influenced by climate remain largely
              unexplored. Skeletal measurements encompassing the dimensions of
              the skull, pelvis, limbs, hands, and feet were collected from
              male (n = 459) and female (n = 442) remains curated in 13
              collections across seven countries in East Asia (n = 901).
              Osteological data were analyzed with sex and minimum temperature
              as covariates adjusted by autosomal single-nucleotide
              polymorphism population genetic distance using univariate
              Bayesian linear mixed models, and credible intervals were
              calculated for each trait. Analysis supports a relationship
              between specific traits and climate as well as providing the
              magnitude of response in both sexes. After accounting for genetic
              distance between populations, greater association between climate
              and morphology was found in postcranial traits, with the
              relationship between climate and the skull limited primarily to
              breadth measurements. Larger body size is associated with colder
              climates with most measurements increasing with decreased
              temperature. The same traits were not always associated with
              climate for males and females nor correlated with the same
              intensity for both sexes. The varied directional association with
              climate for different regions of the skeleton and between the
              sexes underscores the necessity of future ecogeographic research
              to holistically evaluate body form and to look for sex-specific

  abstract = "Thermal tolerance is a fundamental physiological complex trait
              for survival in many species. For example, everyday tasks such as
              foraging, finding a mate, and avoiding predation, are highly
              dependent on how well an organism can tolerate extreme
              temperatures. Understanding the general architecture of the
              natural variants of the genes that control this trait is of high
              importance if we want to better comprehend how this trait evolves
              in natural populations. Here, we take a multipronged approach to
              further dissect the genetic architecture that controls thermal
              tolerance in natural populations using the Drosophila Synthetic
              Population Resource (DSPR) as a model system. First, we used
              quantitative genetics and Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) mapping
              to identify major effect regions within the genome that
              influences thermal tolerance, then integrated RNA-sequencing to
              identify differences in gene expression, and lastly, we used the
              RNAi system to 1) alter tissue-specific gene expression and 2)
              functionally validate our findings. This powerful integration of
              approaches not only allows for the identification of the genetic
              basis of thermal tolerance but also the physiology of thermal
              tolerance in a natural population, which ultimately elucidates
              thermal tolerance through a fitness-associated lens. \#\#\#
