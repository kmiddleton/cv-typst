  abstract     = {Thermal tolerance is a fundamental physiological complex trait
                  for survival in many species. For example, everyday tasks such
                  as foraging, finding a mate, and avoiding predation, are
                  highly dependent on how well an organism can tolerate extreme
                  temperatures. Understanding the general architecture of the
                  natural variants within the genes that control this trait is
                  of high importance if we want to better comprehend thermal
                  physiology. Here, we take a multipronged approach to further
                  dissect the genetic architecture that controls thermal
                  tolerance in natural populations using the Drosophila
                  Synthetic Population Resource (DSPR) as a model system. First,
                  we used quantitative genetics and Quantitative Trait Loci
                  (QTL) mapping to identify major effect regions within the
                  genome that influences thermal tolerance, then integrated
                  RNA-sequencing to identify differences in gene expression, and
                  lastly, we used the RNAi system to 1) alter tissue-specific
                  gene expression and 2) functionally validate our findings.
                  This powerful integration of approaches not only allows for
                  the identification of the genetic basis of thermal tolerance
                  but also the physiology of thermal tolerance in a natural
                  population, which ultimately elucidates thermal tolerance

                  biological growth. However, longitudinal samples are not
                  typically possible, due to limits of time, prohibitive cost,
                  or health concerns of repeat radiologic imaging. In contrast,
                  cross-sectional samples have few such drawbacks, but it is not
                  known how well estimates of growth milestones can be obtained
                  from cross-sectional samples. The Craniofacial Growth
                  Consortium Study (CGCS) contains longitudinal growth data for
                  approximately 2000 individuals. Single samples from the CGCS
                  for individuals representing cross-sectional data were used to
                  test the ability to predict growth parameters in linear trait

                  cross-sectional sample sizes from 5 to the full sample, we

                  approximate growth rates determined from the full longitudinal
                  CGCS sample, with mean absolute differences below 1 mm at
                  cross-sectional sample sizes greater than ~ 200 individuals.
                  Our results show that growth parameters and milestones can be

                  population-level estimates from complete longitudinal data,
                  underscoring the utility of such datasets in growth modeling.
                  This method can be applied to other forms of growth (e.g.,
                  stature) and to cases in which repeated radiographs are not

                  proportions is more complex than previously thought as some
                  traits formerly associated with climate adaptation are better
                  explained by geographic proximity and neutral evolutionary
                  forces. While the recent incorporation of quantitative genetic
                  methodologies has improved understanding of patterns related
                  to climate in Africa, Europe, and the Americas, Asia remains
                  underrepresented in recent and historic studies of body form.
                  As ecogeographic studies tend to focus on male morphology,
                  potential sex differences in features influenced by climate
                  remain largely unexplored. Skeletal measurements encompassing
                  the dimensions of the skull, pelvis, limbs, hands, and feet
                  were collected from male (n = 459) and female (n = 442)
                  remains curated in 13 collections across seven countries in
                  East Asia (n = 901). Osteological data were analyzed with sex

                  using univariate Bayesian linear mixed models, and credible

                  relationship between specific traits and climate as well as
                  providing the magnitude of response in both sexes. After
                  accounting for genetic distance between populations, greater

                  postcranial traits, with the relationship between climate and
                  the skull limited primarily to breadth measurements. Larger
                  body size is associated with colder climates with most
                  measurements increasing with decreased temperature. The same
                  traits were not always associated with climate for males and
                  females nor correlated with the same intensity for both sexes.
                  The varied directional association with climate for different
                  regions of the skeleton and between the sexes underscores the

  abstract     = {Jaw muscles are key features of the vertebrate feeding
                  apparatus. The jaw musculature is housed in the skull whose
                  morphology reflects a compromise between multiple functions,
                  including feeding, housing sensory structures, and defense,
                  and the skull constrains jaw muscle geometry. Thus, jaw muscle
                  anatomy may be suboptimally oriented for the production of
                  bite force. Crocodylians are a group of vertebrates that
                  generate the highest bite forces ever measured with a flat
                  skull suited to their aquatic ambush predatory style. However,
                  basal members of the crocodylian line (e.g., Prestosuchus)
                  were terrestrial predators with plesiomorphically tall skulls,
                  and thus the origin of modern crocodylians involved a
                  substantial reorganization of the feeding apparatus and its
                  jaw muscles. Here, we reconstruct jaw muscles across a
                  phylogenetic range of crocodylians and fossil suchians to
                  investigate the impact of skull flattening on muscle anatomy.
                  We used imaging data to create 3D models of extant and fossil
                  suchians that demonstrate the evolution of the crocodylian
                  skull, using osteological correlates to reconstruct muscle
                  attachment sites. We found that jaw muscle anatomy in early
                  fossil suchians reflected the ancestral archosaur condition
                  but experienced progressive shifts in the lineage leading to
                  Metasuchia. In early fossil suchians, musculus adductor
                  mandibulae posterior and musculus pterygoideus (mPT) were of
                  comparable size, but by Metasuchia, the jaw musculature is
                  dominated by mPT. As predicted, we found that taxa with
                  flatter skulls have less efficient muscle orientations for the
                  production of high bite force. This study highlights the
                  diversity and evolution of jaw muscles in one of the great

                  sources of variation that can result in skeletal malocclusion.
                  Understanding the timing of growth milestones and
                  morphological change associated with adult skeletal
                  malocclusions is critical for developing individualized
                  orthodontic growth modification strategies. To identify
                  patterns in the timing and geometry of growth, we used
                  Bayesian modeling of cephalometrics and geometric morphometric
                  analyses with a dense, longitudinal sample consisting of
                  15,407 cephalograms from 1,913 individuals between 2 and 31
                  years of age. Individuals were classified into vertical facial
                  types (hyper-, normo-, hypo-divergent) and anteroposterior
                  (A-P) skeletal classes (Class I, Class II, Class III) based on
                  adult mandibular plane angle and ANB angle, respectively.
                  These classifications yielded eight facial type-skeletal class
                  categories with sufficient sample sizes to be included in the
                  study. Four linear cephalometrics representing facial heights
                  and maxillary and mandibular lengths were fit to standard
                  double logistic models generating type-class category-specific
                  estimates for age, size, and rate of growth at growth
                  milestones. Mean landmark configurations were compared among
                  type-class categories at four time points between 6 and 20
                  years of age. Overall, morphology and growth patterns were
                  more similar within vertical facial types than within A-P
                  classes and variation among A-P classes typically nested
                  within variation among vertical types. Further,
                  type-class-associated variation in the rate and magnitude of
                  growth in specific regions identified here may serve as
                  targets for clinical treatment of complex vertical and A-P
                  skeletal malocclusion and provide a clearer picture of the

                  rate-based methods for estimating age and size at growth
                  cessation in linear craniofacial measurements. DESIGN: This is
                  a retrospective, longitudinal study. Five linear measurements
                  were collected from lateral cephalograms as part of the
                  Craniofacial Growth Consortium Study (CGCS). Four estimates of
                  growth cessation, including 2 asymptote- (GCasym, GCerr) and 2
                  rate-based (GCabs, GC10\%) methods, from double logistic
                  models of craniofacial growth were compared. PARTICIPANTS:
                  Cephalometric data from participants in 6 historic
                  longitudinal growth studies were included in the CGCS. At
                  least 1749 individuals (870 females, 879 males), unaffected by
                  craniofacial anomalies, were included in all analyses.
                  Individuals were represented by a median of 11 images between
                  2.5 and 31.3 years of age. RESULTS: GCasym consistently
                  occurred before GCerr and GCabs consistently occurred before
                  GC10\% within the rate-based approaches. The ordering of the
                  asymptote-based methods compared to the rate-based methods was
                  not consistent across measurements or between males and
                  females. Across the 5 measurements, age at growth cessation
                  ranged from 13.56 (females, nasion-basion, GCasym) to 24.39
                  (males, sella-gonion, GCerr). CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent growth
                  cessation is an important milestone for treatment planning.
                  Based on our findings, we recommend careful consideration of
                  specific definitions of growth cessation in both clinical and
                  research settings since the most appropriate estimation method
                  may differ according to patients' needs. The different methods
                  presented here provide useful estimates of growth cessation
                  that can be applied to raw data and to a variety of

  abstract     = {Early in the 20th century, a series of studies were initiated
                  across North America to investigate and characterize childhood
                  growth. The Craniofacial Growth Consortium Study (CGCS)
                  combines craniofacial records from six of those growth studies
                  (15,407 lateral cephalograms from 1,913 individuals; 956
                  females, 957 males, primarily European descent). Standard
                  cephalometric points collected from the six studies in the
                  CGCS allows direct comparison of craniofacial growth patterns
                  across six North American locations. Three assessors collected
                  all cephalometric points and the coordinates were averaged for
                  each point. Twelve measures were calculated from the averaged
                  coordinates. We implemented a multilevel double logistic
                  equation to estimate growth trajectories fitting each trait
                  separately by sex. Using Bayesian inference, we fit three
                  models for each trait with different random effects structures
                  to compare differences in growth patterns among studies. The
                  models successfully identified important growth milestones
                  (e.g., age at peak growth velocity, age at cessation of
                  growth) for most traits. In a small number of cases, these
                  milestones could not be determined due to truncated age ranges
                  for some studies and slow, steady growth in some measurements.
                  Results demonstrate great similarity among the six growth
                  studies regarding craniofacial growth milestone estimates and
                  the overall shape of the growth curve. These similarities
                  suggest minor variation among studies resulting from
                  differences in protocol, sample, or possible geographic
                  variation. The analyses presented support combining the
                  studies into the CGCS without substantial concerns of bias.
                  The CGCS, therefore, provides an unparalleled opportunity to
                  examine craniofacial growth from childhood into adulthood.},

  abstract     = {Saurischian dinosaurs evolved seven orders of magnitude in
                  body mass, as well as a wide diversity of hip joint morphology
                  and locomotor postures. The very largest saurischians possess
                  incongruent bony hip joints, suggesting that large volumes of
                  soft tissues mediated hip articulation. To understand the
                  evolutionary trends and functional relationships between body
                  size and hip anatomy of saurischians, we tested the
                  relationships among discrete and continuous morphological
                  characters using phylogenetically corrected regression. Giant
                  theropods and sauropods convergently evolved highly
                  cartilaginous hip joints by reducing supraacetabular
                  ossifications, a condition unlike that in early
                  dinosauromorphs. However, transitions in femoral and
                  acetabular soft tissues indicate that large sauropods and
                  theropods built their hip joints in fundamentally different
                  ways. In sauropods, the femoral head possesses irregularly
                  rugose subchondral surfaces for thick hyaline cartilage. Hip
                  articulation was achieved primarily using the highly
                  cartilaginous femoral head and the supraacetabular labrum on
                  the acetabular ceiling. In contrast, theropods covered their
                  femoral head and neck with thinner hyaline cartilage and
                  maintained extensive articulation between the
                  fibrocartilaginous femoral neck and the antitrochanter. These
                  findings suggest that the hip joints of giant sauropods were
                  built to sustain large compressive loads, whereas those of
                  giant theropods experienced compression and shear forces.},

  abstract     = {The extinct nonavian dinosaur Tyrannosaurus rex, considered
                  one of the hardest biting animals ever, is often hypothesized
                  to have exhibited cranial kinesis, or, mobility of cranial
                  joints relative to the braincase. Cranial kinesis in T. rex is
                  a biomechanical paradox in that forcefully biting tetrapods
                  usually possess rigid skulls instead of skulls with movable
                  joints. We tested the biomechanical performance of a
                  tyrannosaur skull using a series of static positions mimicking
                  possible excursions of the palate to evaluate Postural Kinetic
                  Competency in Tyrannosaurus. A functional extant phylogenetic
                  bracket was employed using taxa, which exhibit measurable
                  palatal excursions: Psittacus erithacus (fore-aft movement)
                  and Gekko gecko (mediolateral movement). Static finite element
                  models of Psittacus, Gekko, and Tyrannosaurus were constructed
                  and tested with different palatal postures using anatomically
                  informed material properties, loaded with muscle forces
                  derived from dissection, phylogenetic bracketing, and a
                  sensitivity analysis of muscle architecture and tested in
                  orthal biting simulations using element strain as a proxy for
                  model performance. Extant species models showed lower strains
                  in naturally occurring postures compared to alternatives. We
                  found that fore-aft and neutral models of Tyrannosaurus
                  experienced lower overall strains than mediolaterally shifted
                  models. Protractor muscles dampened palatal strains, while
                  occipital constraints increased strains about palatocranial
                  joints compared to jaw joint constraints. These loading
                  behaviors suggest that even small excursions can strain
                  elements beyond structural failure. Thus, these postural tests
                  of kinesis, along with the robusticity of other cranial
                  features, suggest that the skull of Tyrannosaurus was
                  functionally akinetic. Anat Rec, 303:999-1017, 2020. © 2019

                  cohesion. Using detailed records tracking the movements and
                  life histories of Finnish evacuees during World War II, we
                  find that evacuees who intermarry are more likely to be
                  educated, work in professional occupations, marry someone
                  higher in social status and remain in the host community.
                  Evacuees who intermarry before the war have fewer children,
                  whereas those who marry into their host community after the
                  war have more children. These results indicate that
                  life-history and assimilation outcomes depend on key
                  differences between pre-war environments-when migrants are
                  living in their own communities-and post-war environments-when
                  migrants are living in the host community. Overall, this
                  suggests that integration involves a trade-off between
                  reproduction and status such that evacuees who integrate gain
                  social status, whereas those who maintain stronger bonds with
                  their natal communities have higher fertility. We discuss
                  these results within the framework of social capital,
                  intergroup conflict and life-history theory and suggest how
                  they can inform our understanding of evolutionary adaptations
                  that affect tribalism.},

                  between bones of the skull and mandible other than at the jaw
                  joint. Many kinetic species possess a particular suite of
                  features to accomplish this movement, including flexible
                  cranial joints and protractor musculature. Whereas the
                  musculoskeletal anatomy of these kinetic systems is well
                  understood, how these joints are biomechanically loaded, how
                  different soft tissues affect joint loading and kinetic
                  capacity, and how the protractor musculature loads the skull
                  remain poorly understood. Here, we present a finite element
                  model of the savannah monitor, Varanus exanthematicus, a
                  modestly kinetic lizard, to better elucidate the roles of soft
                  tissue in mobile joints and protractor musculature in cranial
                  loading. We describe the 3D resultants of jaw muscles and the
                  histology of palatobasal, otic and jaw joints. We tested the
                  effects of joint tissue type, bite point and muscle load to
                  evaluate the biomechanical role of muscles on the palate and
                  braincase. We found that the jaw muscles have significant
                  mediolateral components that can impart stability across
                  palatocranial joints. Articular tissues affect the magnitude
                  of strains experienced around the palatobasal and otic joints.
                  Without protractor muscle loading, the palate, quadrate and
                  braincase experience higher strains, suggesting this muscle
                  helps insulate the braincase and palatoquadrate from high
                  loads. We found that the cross-sectional properties of the
                  bones of V. exanthematicus are well suited for performing
                  under torsional loads. These findings suggest that torsional
                  loading regimes may have played a more important role in the
                  evolution of cranial kinesis in lepidosaurs than previously
                  appreciated.},

  abstract     = {Background: Estimates pertaining to the timing of the
                  adolescent growth spurt (e.g. peak height velocity; PHV),
                  including age at peak height velocity (aPHV), play a critical
                  role in the diagnosis, treatment, and management of skeletal
                  growth and/or developmental disorders. Yet, distinct
                  statistical methodologies often result in large estimate
                  discrepancies.Aim: The aim of the present study was to assess
                  the advantages and disadvantages of three modelling
                  methodologies for height as well as to determine how estimates
                  derived from these methodologies may differ, particularly
                  those that may be useful in paediatric clinical
                  practice.Subjects and methods: Height data from 686
                  individuals of the Fels Longitudinal Study were modelled using
                  5th order polynomials, natural cubic splines, and
                  SuperImposition by Translation and Rotation (SITAR) to
                  determine aPHV and PHV for all individuals together (i.e.
                  population average) by sex and separately for each individual.
                  Estimates within and between methodologies were calculated and
                  compared.Results: In general, mean aPHV was earlier, and PHV
                  was greater for individuals when compared to estimates from
                  population average models. Significant differences between
                  mean aPHV and PHV for individuals were observed in all three
                  methodologies, with SITAR exhibiting the latest aPHV and
                  largest PHV estimates.Conclusion: Each statistical methodology
                  has a number of advantages when used for specific purposes.
                  For modelling growth in individuals, as one would in
                  paediatric clinical practice, we recommend the use of the 5th
                  order polynomial methodology due to its parameter flexibility.},

                  architecture is a critical variable in determining the
                  biomechanical function of the vertebrate musculoskeletal
                  system; however, accurate three-dimensional (3D) understanding
                  of muscle architecture has been historically difficult to
                  acquire. Here, we present a musculoskeletal model of a
                  European starling (Sturnus vulgaris) pectoral girdle generated
                  from iodine contrast-enhanced micro-computed-tomography (CT)
                  data and 3D fiber tracking analysis. We used a template-based
                  fiber-tracking algorithm to reconstruct muscle fibers in 3D
                  based on grayscale differences in CT images, which allowed us
                  to estimate fascicle lengths, pennation angles, muscle
                  volumes, and physiological cross-sectional area. Our modeled
                  muscles were qualitatively accurate; however, quantitative
                  muscle architecture data differed between digital and
                  traditional gross-dissection methods reflecting the complex
                  organization of the tissue and differing natures of data
                  collection. We found that model quality is affected by the
                  resolution of CT image data and the fiber-tracking program’s
                  input parameters. Nonetheless, digital fiber tracking offers
                  numerous advantages over gross-dissection methods, most
                  importantly, the ability to visualize and quantify entire
                  muscles in three-dimensions, yielding a much more accurate
                  estimation of whole muscle architecture.},

                  Constraints exerted by nutrient limitation or nutrient
                  imbalance can influence the maximal value that fitness
                  components such as reproduction and lifespan attains, and
                  organisms may shift how resources are allocated to different
                  structures and functions in response to changes in nutrition.
                  Whether the phenotypic changes associated with changes in
                  nutrition represent an adaptive response is largely unknown.
                  Further, it is unclear whether the response of fitness
                  components to diet even has the potential to evolve in most
                  systems. In this study, we use an admixed multi-parental

                  maximum likelihood ancestral state reconstruction. The hips of
                  dinosauromorphs possessed wide a disparity of soft tissue
                  morphologies beyond the types and combinations exhibited by
                  extant archosaurs. Early evolution of the dinosauriform hip
                  joint was characterized by the retention of a prominent
                  femoral hyaline cartilage cone in post-neonatal individuals,
                  with the cartilage cone independently reduced within theropods
                  and sauropodomorphs. The femur of Dinosauriformes possessed a
                  fibrocartilage sleeve on the metaphysis, which surrounded a
                  hyaline core. The acetabulum of Dinosauriformes possessed
                  distinct labrum and antitrochanter structures. In
                  sauropodomorphs, hip congruence was maintained by thick
                  hyaline cartilage on the femoral head, whereas theropods
                  relied on acetabular tissues such as ligaments and articular
                  pads. In particular, the craniolaterally ossified hip capsule
                  of non-Avetheropoda neotheropods permitted mostly parasagittal
                  femoral movements. These data indicate that the dinosauromorph
                  hip underwent mosaic evolution within the saurischian lineage
                  and that sauropodomorphs and theropods underwent both
                  convergence and divergence in articular soft tissues,
                  correlated with transitions in body size, locomotor posture,
                  and joint loading.SUPPLEMENTAL DATA?Supplemental materials are

  abstract     = {Animals living in and interacting with natural environments
                  must monitor and respond to changing conditions and
                  unpredictable situations. Using information from multiple
                  sensory systems allows them to modify their behavior in
                  response to their dynamic environment but also creates the
                  challenge of integrating different, and potentially
                  contradictory, sources of information for behavior control.
                  Understanding how multiple information streams are integrated
                  to produce flexible and reliable behavior is key to
                  understanding how behavior is controlled in natural settings.
                  Natural settings are rarely still, which challenges animals
                  that require precise body position control, like hummingbirds,
                  which hover while feeding from flowers. Tactile feedback,
                  available only once the hummingbird is docked at the flower,
                  could provide additional information to help maintain its
                  position at the flower. To investigate the role of tactile
                  information for hovering control during feeding, we first
                  asked whether hummingbirds physically interact with a feeder
                  once docked. We quantified physical interactions between
                  docked hummingbirds and a feeder placed in front of a
                  stationary background pattern. Force sensors on the feeder
                  measured a complex time course of loading that reflects the
                  wingbeat frequency and bill movement of feeding hummingbirds,
                  and suggests that they sometimes push against the feeder with
                  their bill. Next, we asked whether the measured tactile
                  interactions were used by feeding hummingbirds to maintain
                  position relative to the feeder. We created two experimental
                  scenarios-one in which the feeder was stationary and the
                  visual background moved and the other where the feeder moved
                  laterally in front of a white background. When the visual
                  background pattern moved, docked hummingbirds pushed
                  significantly harder in the direction of horizontal visual
                  motion. When the feeder moved, and the background was
                  stationary, hummingbirds generated aerodynamic force in the
                  opposite direction of the feeder motion. These results suggest
                  that docked hummingbirds are using visual information about
                  the environment to maintain body position and orientation, and
                  not actively tracking the motion of the feeder. The absence of
                  flower tracking behavior in hummingbirds contrasts with the
                  behavior of hawkmoths, and provides evidence that they rely
                  primarily on the visual background rather than flower-based
                  cues while feeding.},

                  frequently used by anthropologists and paleontologists to
                  infer the loading histories of past populations. To address
                  some underlying assumptions, we investigated the relative
                  roles of genetics and exercise on bone cross-sectional
                  geometry and bending mechanics in three mouse strains: high
                  bone density (C3H/He), low bone density (C57BL/6), and a
                  high-runner strain homozygous for the Myh4Minimscallele (MM).
                  METHODS AND MATERIALS: Weanlings of each strain were divided
                  into exercise (wheel) or control (sedentary) treatment groups
                  for a 7-week experimental period. Morphometrics of the femoral
                  mid-diaphysis and mechanical testing were used to assess both
                  theoretical and ex vivo bending mechanics. RESULTS: Across all
                  measured morphological and bending traits, we found relatively
                  small effects of exercise treatment compared to larger and
                  more frequent interstrain differences. In the exercised group,
                  total distance run over the experimental period was not a
                  predictor of any morphological or bending traits.
                  Cross-sectional geometry did not accurately predict bone
                  response to loading. DISCUSSION: Results from this
                  experimental model do not support hypothesized associations
                  among extreme exercise, cross-sectional geometry, and bending
                  mechanics. Our results suggest that analysis of
                  cross-sectional geometry alone is insufficient to predict
                  loading response, and questions the common assumption that
                  cross-sectional geometry differences are indicative of
                  differential loading history.},

                  influence physiology and behavior over a longer time course,
                  which might have important ramifications under natural
                  conditions. In laboratory rats, for example, acute stress has
                  been shown to increase anxiogenic behaviors for days after a
                  stressor. In this study, we quantified voluntary wheel-running
                  behavior for 22 h following a restraint stress and
                  glucocorticoid levels 24 h postrestraint. We utilized mice
                  from four replicate lines that have been selectively bred for
                  high voluntary wheel-running activity (HR mice) for 60
                  generations and their nonselected control (C) lines to examine
                  potential interactions between exercise propensity and
                  sensitivity to stress. Following 6 d of wheel access on a
                  12L∶12D photo cycle (0700-1900 hours, as during the routine
                  selective breeding protocol), 80 mice were physically
                  restrained for 40 min, beginning at 1400 hours, while another
                  80 were left undisturbed. Relative to unrestrained mice, wheel
                  running increased for both HR and C mice during the first hour
                  postrestraint (P < 0.0001) but did not differ 2 or 3 h
                  postrestraint. Wheel running was also examined at four
                  distinct phases of the photoperiod. Running in the period of
                  1600-1840 hours was unaffected by restraint stress and did not
                  differ statistically between HR and C mice. During the period
                  of peak wheel running (1920-0140 hours), restrained mice
                  tended to run fewer revolutions (-11\%; two-tailed P =
                  0.0733), while HR mice ran 473\% more than C (P = 0.0008),
                  with no restraint × line type interaction. Wheel running
                  declined for all mice in the latter part of the scotophase
                  (0140-0600 hours), restraint had no statistical effect on
                  wheel running, but HR again ran more than C (+467\%; P =
                  0.0122). Finally, during the start of the photophase
                  (0720-1200 hours), restraint increased running by an average
                  of 53\% (P = 0.0443) in both line types, but HR and C mice did
                  not differ statistically. Mice from HR lines had statistically
                  higher plasma corticosterone concentrations than C mice, with
                  no statistical effect of restraint and no interaction between
                  line type and restraint. Overall, these results indicate that
                  acute stress can affect locomotor activity (or activity
                  patterns) for many hours, with the most prominent effect being
                  an increase in activity during a period of typical inactivity
                  at the start of the photophase, 15-20 h poststressor.},

  abstract     = {Turning in flight requires reorientation of force, which
                  birds, bats and insects accomplish either by shifting body
                  position and total force in concert or by using left-right
                  asymmetries in wingbeat kinematics. Although both mechanisms
                  have been observed in multiple species, it is currently
                  unknown how each is used to control changes in trajectory. We
                  addressed this problem by measuring body and wingbeat
                  kinematics as hummingbirds tracked a revolving feeder, and
                  estimating aerodynamic forces using a quasi-steady model.
                  During arcing turns, hummingbirds symmetrically banked the
                  stroke plane of both wings, and the body, into turns,
                  supporting a body-dependent mechanism. However, several
                  wingbeat asymmetries were present during turning, including a
                  higher and flatter outer wingtip path and a lower more
                  deviated inner wingtip path. A quasi-steady analysis of arcing
                  turns performed with different trajectories revealed that
                  changes in radius were associated with asymmetrical kinematics
                  and forces, and changes in velocity were associated with
                  symmetrical kinematics and forces. Collectively, our results
                  indicate that both body-dependent and -independent force
                  orientation mechanisms are available to hummingbirds, and that
                  these kinematic strategies are used to meet the separate
                  aerodynamic challenges posed by changes in velocity and
                  turning radius.},

  abstract     = {Unlike flapping birds and insects, bats possess membrane wings
                  that are more similar to many gliding mammals. The vast
                  majority of the wing is composed of a thin compliant skin
                  membrane stretched between the limbs, hand, and body. Membrane
                  wings are of particular interest because they may offer many
                  advantages to micro air vehicles. One critical feature of
                  membrane wings is that they camber passively in response to
                  aerodynamic load, potentially allowing for simplified wing
                  control. However, for maximum membrane wing performance,
                  tuning of the membrane structure to aerodynamic conditions is
                  necessary. Bats possess an array of muscles, the
                  plagiopatagiales proprii, embedded within the wing membrane
                  that could serve to tune membrane stiffness, or may have
                  alternative functions. We recorded the electromyogram from the
                  plagiopatagiales proprii muscles of Artibeus jamaicensis, the
                  Jamaican fruit bat, in flight at two different speeds and
                  found that these muscles were active during downstroke. For
                  both low- and high-speed flight, muscle activity increased
                  between late upstroke and early downstroke and decreased at
                  late downstroke. Thus, the array of plagiopatagiales may
                  provide a mechanism for bats to increase wing stiffness and
                  thereby reduce passive membrane deformation. These muscles
                  also activate in synchrony, presumably as a means to maximize
                  force generation, because each muscle is small and, by
                  estimation, weak. Small differences in activation timing were
                  observed when comparing low- and high-speed flight, which may
                  indicate that bats modulate membrane stiffness differently
                  depending on flight speed.},

  abstract     = {The biomechanical and neuromuscular mechanisms used by
                  different animals to generate turns in flight are highly
                  variable. Body size and body plan exert some influence, e.g.
                  birds typically roll their body to orient forces generated by
                  the wings whereas insects are capable of turning via
                  left-right wingbeat asymmetries. Turns are also relatively
                  brief and have low repeatability, with almost every wingbeat
                  serving a different function throughout the change in heading.
                  Here we present an analysis of Anna's hummingbirds (Calypte
                  anna) as they fed continuously from an artificial feeder
                  revolving around the outside of the animal. This setup allowed
                  for examination of sustained changes in yaw without requiring
                  any corresponding changes in pitch, roll or body position.
                  Hummingbirds sustained yaw turns by expanding the wing stroke
                  amplitude of the outer wing during the downstroke and by
                  altering the deviation of the wingtip path during both
                  downstroke and upstroke. The latter led to a shift in the
                  inner-outer stroke plane angle during the upstroke and shifts
                  in the elevation of the stroke plane and in the deviation of
                  the wingtip path during both strokes. These features are
                  generally more similar to how insects, as opposed to birds,
                  turn. However, time series analysis also revealed considerable
                  stroke-to-stroke variation. Changes in the stroke amplitude
                  and the wingtip velocity were highly cross-correlated, as were
                  changes in the stroke deviation and the elevation of the
                  stroke plane. As was the case for wingbeat kinematics,
                  electromyogram recordings from pectoral and wing muscles were
                  highly variable, but no correlations were found between these
                  two features of motor control. The high variability of both
                  kinematic and muscle activation features indicates a high
                  level of wingbeat-to-wingbeat adjustments during sustained
                  yaw. The activation timing of the muscles was more repeatable
                  than the activation intensity, which suggests that the former
                  may be constrained by harmonic motion and that the latter may
                  play a large role in kinematic adjustments. Comparing the
                  revolution frequency of the feeder with measurements of free
                  flight yaws reveals that feeder tracking, even at one
                  revolution every 2 s, is well below the maximum yaw capacity
                  of the hummingbirds.},

  abstract     = {The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is involved in regulation of
                  various physiological functions, including locomotion,
                  antinociception, emotional states, and motivated behaviors.
                  The ECS has been implicated in regulation of voluntary wheel
                  running in mice via actions at the cannabinoid receptor-1
                  (CB1). Previously, we showed that four replicate lines of mice
                  bred for high levels of voluntary wheel running (high-runner
                  or HR lines) sex-specifically (females only) decreased running
                  in response to antagonism of the CB1 receptor, as compared
                  with four unselected Control lines. Here, we administered a
                  CB1 receptor agonist, WIN 55,212-2 (WIN). We predicted that if
                  CB1 activation is involved in the regulation of voluntary
                  wheel running, then HR mice would show a greater response to
                  CB1 agonism. Following our previous protocols, mice from
                  generation 53 were acclimated to running wheels for 24 days,
                  then received, in random order, either an intra-peritoneal
                  injection of vehicle or a low (0.5 mg/kg), medium (1 mg/kg) or
                  high dosage (3 mg/kg) of WIN. Each mouse received an injection
                  and then experienced two nights without injections, for a
                  total period of 12 days. Response to WIN was quantified as
                  wheel revolutions, time spent running, and average running
                  speed in the 10-120 min immediately following injection.
                  Injection decreased wheel revolutions in all mice, but male HR
                  mice decreased their running to a greater degree relative to
                  Controls in response to the high dose of WIN over the entire
                  period analyzed, whereas HR females showed a differential
                  response relative to Controls only in the latter 70-120 min
                  post-injection. These results, in conjunction with our
                  previous study, show that (a) aspects of endocannabinoid
                  signaling have diverged in four lines of mice bred for high
                  levels of voluntary exercise and (b) male and female HR mice
                  differ from one another in CB1 signaling as it relates to
                  wheel running.},

                  the four replicate high runner (HR) lines averaged 2.85-fold
                  more revolutions per day as compared with four non-selected

                  indicated significant differences among C lines but not among

                  significantly among HR lines, but not among C, and showed a

                  the trait under direct selection while promoting divergence in
                  the lower-level components of that trait.},

                  behavioral (motivation, reward) and anatomical/physiological
                  (ability) elements. In the present study, oxygen transport was
                  investigated as a possible limitation to further increases in
                  running by four replicate lines of mice that have been
                  selectively bred for high voluntary wheel running and have
                  reached an apparent selection limit. To increase oxygen
                  transport capacity, erythrocyte density was elevated by the
                  administration of an erythropoietin (EPO) analogue. Mice were
                  given two EPO injections, two days apart, at one of two dose
                  levels (100 or 300 microg kg(-1)). Hemoglobin concentration
                  ([Hb]), maximal aerobic capacity during forced treadmill
                  exercise (VO2,max) and voluntary wheel running were measured.
                  [Hb] did not differ between high runner (HR) and non-selected
                  control (C) lines without EPO treatment. Both doses of EPO
                  significantly (P<0.0001) increased [Hb] as compared with
                  sham-injected animals, with no difference in [Hb] between the
                  100 microg kg(-1) and 300 microg kg(-1) dose levels (overall
                  mean of 4.5 g dl(-1) increase). EPO treatment significantly
                  increased VO2,max by approximately 5\% in both the HR and C
                  lines, with no dose x line type interaction. However, wheel
                  running (revolutions per day) did not increase with EPO
                  treatment in either the HR or C lines, and in fact
                  significantly decreased at the higher dose in both line types.
                  These results suggest that neither [Hb] per se nor VO2,max is
                  limiting voluntary wheel running in the HR lines. Moreover, we
                  hypothesize that the decrease in wheel running at the higher
                  dose of EPO may reflect direct action on the reward pathway of
                  the brain.},

                  of neurobiological rewards during and after prolonged
                  exercise. Mice from lines that have been selectively bred for
                  high voluntary wheel running (high runner or HR lines) may
                  have evolved neurobiological mechanisms that increase the

                  (SR141716), a selective cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist.
                  During the time of normal peak running, each mouse received,

                  however, female HR mice differentially decreased running speed

  abstract     = {The study of morphological evolution after the inferred origin
                  of active flight homologous with that in Aves has historically
                  been characterized by an emphasis on anatomically disjunct,
                  mosaic patterns of change. Relatively few prior studies have
                  used discrete morphological character data in a phylogenetic
                  context to quantitatively investigate morphological evolution
                  or mosaic evolution in particular. One such previously
                  employed method, which used summed unambiguously optimized
                  synapomorphies, has been the basis for proposing disassociated
                  and sequential "modernizing" or "fine-tuning" of pectoral and
                  then pelvic locomotor systems after the origin of flight
                  ("pectoral early-pelvic late" hypothesis). We use one of the
                  most inclusive phylogenetic data sets of basal birds to
                  investigate properties of this method and to consider the
                  application of a Bayesian phylogenetic approach. Bayes factor
                  and statistical comparisons of branch length estimates were
                  used to evaluate support for a mosaic pattern of character
                  change and the specific pectoral early-pelvic late hypothesis.
                  Partitions were defined a priori based on anatomical subregion
                  (e.g., pelvic, pectoral) and were based on those hypothesized
                  using the summed synapomorphy approach. We compare 80 models
                  all implementing the M(k) model for morphological data but
                  varying in the number of anatomical subregion partitions, the
                  models for among-partition rate variation and among-character
                  rate variation, as well as the branch length prior.
                  Statistical analysis reveals that partitioning data by
                  anatomical subregion, independently estimating branch lengths
                  for partitioned data, and use of shared or per partition
                  gamma-shaped among-character rate distribution significantly
                  increases estimated model likelihoods. Simulation studies
                  reveal that partitioned models where characters are randomly
                  assigned perform significantly worse than both the observed
                  model and the single-partition equal-rate model, suggesting
                  that only partitioning by anatomical subregion increases model
                  performance. The preference for models with partitions defined
                  a priori by anatomical subregion is consistent with a
                  disjunctive pattern of character change for the data set
                  investigated and may have implications for parameterization of
                  Bayesian analyses of morphological data more generally.
                  Statistical tests of differences in estimated branch lengths
                  from the pectoral and pelvic partitions do not support the
                  specific pectoral early-pelvic late hypothesis proposed from
                  the summed synapomorphy approach; however, results suggest
                  limited support for some pectoral branch lengths being
                  significantly longer only early at/after the origin of flight.},

                  hallux of nonavian theropod dinosaurs was unreversed and lay
                  parallel to digits II-IV. Among basal birds, a unique digital
                  innovation evolved in which the hallux opposes digits II-IV.
                  This digital configuration is critical for grasping and
                  perching. I studied skeletons of modern birds with a range of
                  hallucal designs, from unreversed (anteromedially directed) to
                  fully reversed (posteriorly directed). Two primary correlates
                  of hallucal orientation were revealed. First, the fossa into
                  which metatarsal I articulates is oriented slightly more
                  posteriorly on the tarsometatarsus, rotating the digit as a
                  unit. Second, metatarsal I exhibits a distinctive torsion of
                  its distal shaft relative to its proximal articulation with
                  the tarsometatarsus, reorienting the distal condyles and
                  phalanges of digit I. Herein, I present a method that
                  facilitates the re-evaluation of hallucal orientation in
                  fossil avians based on morphology alone. This method also
                  avoids potential misinterpretations of hallucal orientation in

                  groups: predatory, reduced, flying, wing-propelled diving, and
                  flighdess. Forelimbs which maintained their primitive
                  function, predation, are similarly proportioned, but non-avian
                  theropods with highly reduced forelimbs have relatively longer

  abstract     = {ABSTRACT The evolution of theropod flight has been
                  characterized as a shift from one to three locomotor modules.
                  Basal theropods, which were terrestrial bipeds, had a single
                  locomotor module composed of the hind limb and tail. In birds,
                  aerial locomotion was acquired with the origination of the
                  wing module and a decoupling of the hind limb and tail into
                  separate pelvic and caudal modules. This increase in
                  modularity is thought to have granted birds more locomotor
                  ?options? than non-avian theropods. More specifically, an
                  aerial locomotor system could have eased constraints on the
                  hind limb and allowed specialization for habitats and
                  lifestyles unavailable to non-birds. If so, bird hind limbs
                  should be more disparate than those of non-avian theropods. We
                  addressed this hypothesis by visualizing one aspect of limb
                  design, the proportions of the three main segments, using
                  ternary diagrams. Our results show that avian hind limb
                  proportions are much more disparate than those of non-avian
                  theropods. This broad range of limb design correlates with a
                  radiation in locomotor diversity founded on three locomotor
                  modules. We propose that birds have reached regions of
                  proportion morphospace that are off limits to bipeds with only
                  one locomotor module. In comparison, the limbs of non-avian
                  theropods are conservatively proportioned. Despite great
                  variation in body size, theropods other than birds do not
                  exhibit specializations for locomotion other than terrestrial
                  bipedalism. Although other aspects of size and shape need to
                  be analyzed, the relationship between modular flexibility and
                  morphological disparity appears to play an important role in
                  theropod locomotor evolution.},

                  was small (10\%). Significant main effects for wheel running
                  were also revealed for sex and line (P < 0.001). The grand
                  mean +/- SD for the coefficient of variation (CV) of
                  intra-individual wheel running was 23.0 +/- 10.8\%. Although a

                  which to investigate forces experienced by the skull during
                  feeding and other behaviors. American alligators (Alligator
                  mississippiensis) generate some of the highest measured bite
                  forces among extant tetrapods. A concomitant increase in bite
                  force accompanies ontogenetic increases in body mass, which
                  has been linked with dietary changes as animals increase in
                  size. Because the flattened skull of crocodylians has
                  substantial mediolaterally oriented muscles, crocodylians are
                  an excellent model taxon in which to explore the role of
                  mediolateral force components experienced by the feeding
                  apparatus. Many previous modeling studies of archosaur cranial
                  function focused on planar analysis, ignoring the mediolateral
                  aspects of cranial forces. Here, we used three-dimensionally
                  accurate anatomical data to resolve 3D muscle forces. Using
                  dissection, imaging and computational techniques, we developed
                  lever and finite element models of an ontogenetic series of
                  alligators to test the effects of size and shape on cranial
                  loading and compared estimated bite forces with those
                  previously measured in vivo in A. mississippiensis We found
                  that modeled forces matched in vivo data well for
                  intermediately sized individuals, and somewhat overestimated
                  force in smaller specimens and underestimated force in larger
                  specimens, suggesting that ontogenetically static muscular
                  parameters and bony attachment sites alone cannot account for
                  all the variation in bite force. Adding aponeurotic muscle
                  attachments would likely improve force predictions, but such
                  data are challenging to model and integrate into analyses of
                  extant taxa and are generally unpreserved in fossils. We
                  conclude that anatomically accurate modeling of muscles can be
                  coupled with finite element and lever analyses to produce
                  reliable, reasonably accurate estimate bite forces and thus
                  both skeletal and joint loading, with known sources of error,
                  which can be applied to extinct taxa.},

  abstract     = {In this study we compared the wing kinematics of 27 bats
                  representing six pteropodid species ranging more than 40 times
                  in body mass (M(b)=0.0278-1.152 kg), to determine whether wing
                  posture and overall wing kinematics scaled as predicted
                  according to theory. The smallest species flew in a wind
                  tunnel and the other five species in a flight corridor.
                  Seventeen kinematic markers on the midline and left side of
                  the body were tracked in three dimensions. We used
                  phylogenetically informed reduced major axis regression to
                  test for allometry. We found that maximum wingspan (b(max))
                  and maximum wing area (S(max)) scaled with more positive
                  allometry, and wing loading (Q(s)) with more negative
                  allometry (b(max)∝M(b)(0.423); S(max)∝M(b)(0.768);
                  Q(s)∝M(b)(0.233)) than has been reported in previous studies
                  that were based on measurements from specimens stretched out
                  flat on a horizontal surface. Our results suggest that larger
                  bats open their wings more fully than small bats do in flight,
                  and that for bats, body measurements alone cannot be used to
                  predict the conformation of the wings in flight. Several
                  kinematic variables, including downstroke ratio, wing stroke
                  amplitude, stroke plane angle, wing camber and Strouhal
                  number, did not change significantly with body size,
                  demonstrating that many aspects of wing kinematics are similar
                  across this range of body sizes. Whereas aerodynamic theory
                  suggests that preferred flight speed should increase with
                  mass, we did not observe an increase in preferred flight speed
                  with mass. Instead, larger bats had higher lift coefficients
                  (C(L)) than did small bats (C(L)∝M(b)(0.170)). Also, the slope
                  of the wingbeat period (T) to body mass regression was
                  significantly more shallow than expected under isometry
                  (T∝M(b)(0.180)), and angle of attack (α) increased
                  significantly with body mass [α∝log(M(b))7.738]. None of the
                  bats in our study flew at constant speed, so we used multiple
                  regression to isolate the changes in wing kinematics that
                  correlated with changes in flight speed, horizontal
                  acceleration and vertical acceleration. We uncovered several
                  significant trends that were consistent among species. Our
                  results demonstrate that for medium- to large-sized bats, the
                  ways that bats modulate their wing kinematics to produce
                  thrust and lift over the course of a wingbeat cycle are
                  independent of body size.},

                  specialized for flight, reflecting both evolutionary history
                  and the need to maintain structural integrity while generating
                  aerodynamic forces. METHODS: We analyzed the anatomical
                  structure of bat wing skeletons in the context of scaling
                  patterns relative to other mammals, material properties and
                  the mechanical function of the wing bones during flight.
                  RESULTS: Compared with nonvolant mammals, the bones of the bat
                  forelimb are elongated, even after correcting for shared
                  phylogenetic history. Bats have consistently larger-diameter
                  bones in the forelimb than do nonvolant mammals but
                  significantly narrower hindlimb bones. Mineralization in the
                  cortical bone of wings is lower than in the long bones of
                  other adult mammals, with a proximodistal gradient of
                  decreasing mineralization. The distal phalanges have only a
                  small amount of mineralized tissue underlying the articular
                  cartilage. Loads required to elicit a 10\% length deflection
                  in the wing bones of Glossophaga soricina varied approximately
                  50-fold along the wing and flexural stiffness nearly 200-fold.
                  Commensurate with low mineralization and flexural stiffness,
                  bat bones experience extraordinarily high bending strains
                  during flight. CONCLUSION: Bat limb skeletons share features
                  with other mammals and possess specialized characteristics,
                  mostly related to the mechanical demands of flight.},

                  the structure of bone, contributing to its mechanical behavior

                  novel approach to simultaneously address the genetically
                  mediated, exercise-related effects on bone morphometrics and
                  strength, using mice that had been selectively bred for high
                  levels of voluntary wheel running (16 generations). Female
                  mice from high running and control lines were either allowed
                  (n=12, 12, respectively) or denied (n=11, 12, respectively)
                  access to wheels for 20 months. Femoral shaft, neck, and head
                  were measured with calipers and via micro-computed tomography.
                  Fracture characteristics of the femoral head were assessed in
                  cantilever bending. After adjusting for variation in body mass
                  by two-way analysis of covariance, distal width of the femur
                  increased as a result of selective breeding, and mediolateral
                  femoral diameter was reduced by wheel access. Cross-sectional
                  area of the femoral mid-shaft showed a significant linetype x
                  activity effect, increasing with wheel access in high-running
                  lines but decreasing in control lines. Body mass was
                  significantly positively correlated with many of the
                  morphometric traits studied. Fracture load of the femoral neck
                  was strongly positively predicted by morphometric traits of
                  the femoral neck (r2>0.30), but no significant effects of
                  selective breeding or wheel access were found. The significant
                  correlations of body mass with femoral morphometric traits
                  underscore the importance of controlling for body size when
                  analyzing the response of bone size and shape to experimental
                  treatments. After controlling for body mass, measures of the
                  femoral neck remain significant predictors of femoral neck

  abstract     = {Limb bone diaphyseal structure is frequently used to infer
                  hominin activity levels from skeletal remains, an approach
                  based on the well-documented ability of bone to adjust to its
                  loading environment during life. However, diaphyseal structure
                  is also determined in part by genetic factors. This study
                  investigates the possibility that genetic variation underlying
                  diaphyseal structure is influenced by the activity levels of
                  ancestral populations and might also have functional
                  significance in an evolutionary context. We adopted an
                  experimental evolution approach and tested for differences in
                  femoral diaphyseal structure in 1-week-old mice from a line
                  that had been artificially selected (45 generations) for high
                  voluntary wheel running and non-selected controls. As adults,
                  selected mice are significantly more active on wheels and in
                  home cages, and have thicker diaphyses. Structural differences
                  at 1 week can be assumed to primarily reflect the effects of
                  selective breeding rather than direct mechanical stimuli,
                  given that the onset of locomotion in mice is shortly after
                  Day 7. We hypothesized that if genetically determined
                  diaphyseal structure reflects the activity patterns of members
                  of a lineage, then selected animals will have relatively
                  larger diaphyseal dimensions at 1 week compared to controls.
                  The results provide strong support for this hypothesis and
                  suggest that limb bone cross sections may not always only
                  reflect the activity levels of particular fossil individuals,
                  but also convey an evolutionary signal providing information
                  about hominin activity in the past.},

                  artificial selection for high activity in the form of wheel
                  running, in which mice engage voluntarily. Mice from the four
                  replicate High Runner (HR) lines run nearly three times as
                  many revolutions during days 5 and 6 of a 6-day exposure to
                  wheels (1.12 m circumference). We have found significant
                  changes in skeletal dimensions of the hind limbs, including
                  decreased directional asymmetry, larger femoral heads, and
                  wider distal femora. The latter two have been hypothesized as
                  evolutionary adaptations for long-distance locomotion in
                  hominids. Exercise-training studies involving experimental
                  groups with and without access to wheels have shown increased
                  diameters of both femora and tibiafibulae, and suggest genetic
                  effects on trainability (genotype-by-environment
                  interactions). Reanalysis of previously published data on bone
                  masses of hind limbs revealed novel patterns of change in bone
                  mass associated with access to wheels for 2 months. Without
                  access to wheels, HR mice have significantly heavier
                  tibiafibulae and foot bones, whereas with chronic access to
                  wheels, a significant increase in foot bone mass that was
                  linearly related to increases in daily wheel running was
                  observed. Mice exhibiting a recently discovered small-muscle
                  phenotype ("mini-muscle," [MM] caused by a Mendelian recessive
                  gene), in which the mass of the triceps surae muscle complex

                  and MM phenotypes in mice of 1-7 weeks postnatal age.
                  Statistical comparisons reveal highly significant differences
                  both in triceps surae mass and mass-corrected triceps surae
                  mass between normal and MM mice at all but the postnatal age
                  of 1 week. Based on previously observed differences in
                  distributions of myosin isoforms in adult MM mice, we
                  hypothesize that a reduction of myosin heavy-chain type-IIb
                  isoforms with accounts for our observed ontogenetic changes in
                  muscle mass.},

  abstract     = {The hierarchical structure of bone, involving micro-scale
                  organization and interaction of material components, is a
                  critical determinant of macro-scale mechanics. Changes in
                  whole-bone morphology in response to the actions of individual
                  genes, physiological loading during life, or evolutionary
                  processes, may be accompanied by alterations in underlying
                  mineralization or architecture. Here, we used nanoindentation
                  to precisely measure compressive stiffness in the femoral
                  mid-diaphysis of mice that had experienced 37 generations of
                  selective breeding for high levels of voluntary wheel running
                  (HR). Mice (n = 48 total), half from HR lines and half from
                  non-selected control (C) lines, were divided into two
                  experimental groups, one with 13-14 weeks of access to a
                  running wheel and one housed without wheels (n = 12 in each
                  group). At the end of the experiment, gross and micro-computed
                  tomography (microCT)-based morphometric traits were measured,
                  and reduced elastic modulus (E(r)) was estimated separately
                  for four anatomical quadrants of the femoral cortex: anterior,
                  posterior, lateral, and medial. Two-way, mixed-model analysis
                  of covariance (ancova) showed that body mass was a highly
                  significant predictor of all morphometric traits and that
                  structural change is more apparent at the microCT level than
                  in conventional morphometrics of whole bones. Both line type
                  (HR vs. C) and presence of the mini-muscle phenotype (caused
                  by a Mendelian recessive allele and characterized by a
                  approximately 50\% reduction in mass of the gastrocnemius
                  muscle complex) were significant predictors of femoral
                  cortical cross-sectional anatomy. Measurement of reduced
                  modulus obtained by nanoindentation was repeatable within a
                  single quadrant and sensitive enough to detect
                  inter-individual differences. Although we found no significant
                  effects of line type (HR vs. C) or physical activity (wheel
                  vs. no wheel) on mean stiffness, anterior and posterior
                  quadrants were significantly stiffer (P < 0.0001) than medial
                  and lateral quadrants (32.67 and 33.09 GPa vs. 29.78 and 30.46
                  GPa, respectively). Our findings of no significant difference
                  in compressive stiffness in the anterior and posterior
                  quadrants agree with previous results for mice, but differ
                  from those for large mammals. Integrating these results with
                  others from ongoing research on these mice, we hypothesize
                  that the skeletons of female HR mice may be less sensitive to
                  the effects of chronic exercise, due to decreased circulating
                  leptin levels and potentially altered endocannabinoid
                  signaling.},
